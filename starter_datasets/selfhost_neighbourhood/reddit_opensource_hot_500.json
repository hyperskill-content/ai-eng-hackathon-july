Can move data from a drive to another drive, to the cloud, off the cloud, whatever. There aren't very many open source data migration tools and especially not ones that support cross platform migrations. It's one of a kind and using ground breaking techniques to do it extremely quick and robustly. The code base is clean and easily extendable to support more services and features along the way. \n    \nTech stack: Go (back end and core logic), JS (front end) (probably react or solid), DuckDB for storage of logs and paths found / created, NSIS installer. A little of python and shell scripts for build scripts and tear down and testing probably. \n    \nHelp needed: right now I have to finish the core logic of the software. I have it all written out on paper but actually coding and debugging it is a little hard. I don't know if anyone really wants to help me with this as it's pretty tricky. BUT once I finish that, I'll definitely need contributors for the front end UI / UX design. It will be an absolutely beautiful piece of software, not your typical soulless corporate BS. So it will be fun to work on. I also need technical writers for the documentation and user tutorials as well. And I'll probably need another core programmer for the backend logic and installer. There's lots of room for help honestly. \n    \nAdditional information: I have written lots of documentation already on the whole architecture and software design of it all on the GitHub wiki pages and posted lots of issues already. If anyone is interested and wants to help me please jump in or DM me and I would be very happy to help you onboard onto such a wonderful project. It would be a killer project to have on a resume. It's not just a typical desktop app. For my front end people it will be BEAUTIFUL and an amazing portfolio piece. For my backend people we're using Go with a pubsub like architecture, there's a lot of concurrency, async coding, and SQL DB concepts you can learn and apply here. So it's a really killer project to have on your resume. \n\nAny help at all is greatly appreciated and I won't just drop tasks on people and abandon them. I'm here to help every step of the way as much as I can.",

The biggest advantage of doing so is that the application services can be injected directly into the UI components. No need for api calls through the network, and thus no security or authentication issues to deal with.\n\nThe first thing I would like to get help for is this fork of the well-known Adminer database admin tool: https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-mono. This is actually a monorepo with all the packages of the project, as well as a docker compose file to start a demo and scripts to populate sample databases with datasets freely available online.\n\nI would also be very happy to have some feedbacks on this package, also built with Jaxon: https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-supervisor. It's an admin dashboard for Supervisor, the process manager. https://supervisord.org.\n\nThis other package also needs some help: https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-flot. It provides a PHP api to build graphs, and Jaxon based UI components to display them with a Javascript library. The PHP api needs to be enriched, support for more Javascript libraries would also be welcomed.\n\nThe last point on which I need help, is to have some ideas about useful things that can be built in the WordPress ecosystem using such a library.\n\nThanks in advance.",

While successful in generating revenue, these activities split the team’s focus, with FOSS often taking a backseat when paying customers had urgent needs.\n\nThe Devolutions sponsorship changes everything. We can speed up growing the team and justify having engineers focus exclusively on FOSS without worrying about funding.\n\nI hope we can replicate this model with more sponsors and that more businesses support OSS like Devolutions does. If every business using OSS engaged meaningfully in supporting the projects they depend on, it would be a game-changer for sustainable open source development.",

It even works on CPU(can generate professional presentation with as small as 3b models)!\n\n**Presentation Generation UI**\n\n* It has beautiful user-interface which can be used to create presentations.\n* 7+ beautiful themes to choose from.\n* Can choose number of slides, languages and themes.\n* Can create presentation from PDF, PPTX, DOCX, etc files directly.\n* Export to PPTX, PDF.\n* Share presentation link.(if you host on public IP)\n\n**Presentation Generation over API**\n\n* You can even host the instance to generation presentation over API. (1 endpoint for all above features)\n* All above features supported over API\n* You'll get two links; first the static presentation file (pptx/pdf) which you requested and editable link through which you can edit the presentation and export the file.\n\nWould love for you to try it out! Very easy docker based setup and deployment.\n\nHere's the github link: https://github.com/presenton/presenton.\n\nAlso check out the docs here: https://docs.presenton.ai.",

Neither produced a presentation that was \"ready to go\" out of the box, but the one using ChatGPT was a good starting point. The gemma3:12b had incomplete text on the slides and was generally unusable, probably due to limitations on the power of the model.\n\nIt would be great to see a version of this that integrates with the [LMStudio endpoints](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/app/api). I find LMStudio to have the best support for running models with AMD GPU acceleration locally. I'm no developer, but my understanding is that it's endpoints are not compatible with the OpenAI python SDK used in the project currently, so this might be a bigger ask.\n\nIt would also be nice to have the Pexels integration even when running a cloud LLM if we don't want to pay for (or just don't like) AI images.",

[zenta](https://github.com/e6a5/zenta): For resetting your mind.\n\nThe workflow is simple:\n\n* Start a focused session with flow start \"my one task\".\n* When your mind wanders, type breath to run a quick, calming breathing exercise from zenta.\n* When you're done, flow end logs your work.\n\n**flow** helps you commit to a single task, and **zenta** helps you stay with it.   \nBoth are minimalist, private (everything is local), and designed to keep you in the terminal. If you're trying to build a habit of deep work, I hope you'll check them out.  \nLet me know what you think!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been working on 3 side projects over the past few months mainly to improve the code, write better documentation and enhance backend, tests and code coverage. After some hard work, I reached 100% code coverage on two projects and 99% on the other one.\n\n1. First project with 100% code coverage (car rental): [https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars](https://github.com/aelassas/bookcars)\n2. Second one with 100% code coverage (single vendor marketplace): [https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce](https://github.com/aelassas/wexcommerce)\n3. Third one with 99% code coverage (property rental): [https://github.com/aelassas/movinin](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin)\n\nAll three can be self-hosted on a server or VPS with or without Docker.\n\nAll three are MIT-licensed and open to contributions. The license is permissive. This means that you have lots of permission and few restrictions. You have permission to use the code, to modify it, to publish it, make something with it, use it in commercial products and sell it, etc.\n\nWhat took me a lot of time and hard work was testing payment gateways. All three projects come with Stripe and PayPal payment gateways integration. You can choose which one you want to use depending on your business location or business model during installation/configuration step. Everything is documented in GitHub wiki for each project.\n\nI wrote the backend, frontend, mobile apps, and 80% of tests myself. I used AI for some tests and database queries. AI helped me with some complex MongoDB queries or when I got stuck trying to implement some new features like date based pricing for bookcars.\n\nAny feedback welcome.",

    "selftext": "I just want to share a Chromium-based browser extension I've been working on, **Cloaxa**. My goal was to create a robust, browser-level solution for IP masking and combating common web tracking techniques, especially for those who want more control over their online anonymity without necessarily needing a full system-wide VPN.\n\nBasically, it routes your browser's web traffic through the Tor network (via a local Tor service) and implements several features to make you less trackable while browsing.\n\nThe reason why I made it is I want similar browser-level protections of Tor browser but within my regular Chromium browser. Cloaxa aims to fill that gap by integrating Tor proxying with essential anti-tracking features directly into your browser.\n\nCheck in the github repo if you are interested. (open for issues, discussions, and contributions)  \n[https://github.com/nylla8444/Cloaxa](https://github.com/nylla8444/Cloaxa)\n\nHope you all find this interesting, thank you all! :))",

Or does the removal provision mean they remain separately removable despite being \"treated as though\" included?\n\nPractical scenario: I have GPL v3 code with additional permissions. I want to remove those additional permissions when I redistribute. The first clause suggests they're now permanently part of the license, while the second clause explicitly grants removal rights.\n\nCould you please clarify:\n\nDo additional permissions become permanently integrated into the GPL terms?\nHow do these two provisions work together?\nWhat is the correct interpretation for removal rights?\nThank you for your guidance on this important licensing question.",

Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n> \n> When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nFor me, if I received a GPLv3 copy of a C compiler with an embedded C standard library that expressed additional permissions in the form of an exception that programs that link with its C standard library do not become a covered work under the GPLv3 (and thus has to be covered by the GPLv3), I would feel comfortable removing that additional permission if I convey the work.  In this case, without the exception, any downstream recipients that link with the C standard library of the modified work would have their programs become covered works under the GPLv3 as indicated by the license text.\n\nIf the additional permissions further restricts the GPLv3, then I feel comfortable ignoring and removing it as further restrictions are explicitly allowed to be removed.\n\nHowever, this is only legal information and what I feel comfortable doing.

    "title": "Beginner in Dev, Want to Contribute to GSoC – How to Get Started with Real-World Code?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,  \nI'm going into my 2nd year of college and recently started learning development (mostly MERN stack – frontend and backend basics). I've built some small projects following tutorials and I'm really interested in contributing to GSoC in the future. But I’ve never contributed to open source before, and everything feels a bit overwhelming right now.\n\nI have a few questions and would really appreciate if someone could guide me through this phase:\n\n**1. How to pick a GSoC organization?**  \nThere are so many listed orgs. How do I know which one suits me as a beginner? Should I look for ones that use tech I already know (like Node, React, etc.) or pick based on beginner-friendly tags?\n\n**2. Real-world code vs tutorial code?**  \nI noticed that the production-level codebases in open source are very different from the tutorial projects I built. The folder structure, file sizes, naming conventions, and best practices are much more advanced.  \nHow can I make my code more “production ready” and efficient? Any specific things I should learn or practice?\n\n**3. How to get started with contributions?**  \nI’ve never made a contribution before. What kind of first issues should I look for? And how to approach reading large codebases when everything feels unfamiliar?\n\n**4. Should I focus fully on Dev for now or also do DSA?**  \nI’m also starting DSA in college this semester. Should I give more time to Dev and open source right now, or balance it with DSA/CP too?\n\nIf anyone has been through this stage or successfully got into GSoC from scratch, your roadmap or tips would be a huge help. I’m ready to put in consistent effort but just need some clarity on how to move in the right direction.",

    "title": "Thoughts on open source OCR for real-world documents",
    "selftext": "Working on a document extraction pipeline recently and found myself comparing a few OCR options, specifically Nanonets, OlmOCR, and the newly launched OCRFlux. I use them mainly for processing scanned PDFs and image-based forms (invoices, compliance docs, old manuals), documents with complex layouts (multi-column text, tables, headers/footers), and wanting structured outputs for downstream NLP (eventually feeding into a RAG setup).\n\n\n\n1. Nanonets\n\n\\- Cloud-based, commercial API, but offers a limited free tier for testing\n\n\\- Super polished in terms of UX and model performance, really good at extracting structured fields (esp. invoices/forms)\n\n\\- Black box though: no local control, no transparency over model behavior\n\n\\- Not open source, which limits usage in privacy-sensitive environments\n\n\n\n2. OlmOCR\n\n\\- Open-source, built for decentralized contexts (used in projects like Ockam)\n\n\\- Focused on OCR from images, not full-document layout parsing\n\n\\- Simple architecture, decent for clean scans, but layout reconstruction is limited\n\n\\- Outputs mostly plain text. Not great if you need tables/structure preserved\n\n\n\n3. OCRFlux\n\n\\- Just launched. Early stage, but actively maintained\n\n\\- Outputs structured JSON (text, position, block metadata), which plays nicely with document chunking, embeddings, and downstream LLM pipelines\n\n\\- Handles tables and multi-column formats well for an OSS tool\n\n\\- Rough edges, but promising if you want a fully local, transparent preprocessing step\n\n\n\nNanonets is excellent if you’re okay with a paid, black-box cloud solution. It's probably the most accurate and polished of the three. OlmOCR is lightweight and OSS but better suited for simple OCR tasks with its limited layout handling. OCRFlux feels like a middle ground: open-source, layout-aware, and designed for actual document structure, good for building your own tools on top of\n\n\n\nAlso open to hear what others are using, especially if there are other new OSS tools I’ve missed.",

        "body": "Really thoughtful comparison, love how clearly you’ve laid out the pros and cons here. I work at Docsumo, so I spend a lot of time thinking about these exact trade-offs in document extraction.\n\nNanonets is definitely one of the smoother tools to use if you’re okay with the black-box nature. But we’ve seen a lot of teams run into limits when they need more transparency or control, especially around edge-case layouts and custom validations. OlmOCR is solid for lightweight jobs, but yeah—once tables and multi-column formats come in, it struggles a bit.\n\nOCRFlux is the one I’ve been watching closely too. That structured JSON output is a big deal if you're planning to feed it into embeddings or build your own RAG setup. It still has rough edges, but promising direction for sure.\n\nAt Docsumo, we've taken a slightly different approach- we're not open-source, but we focus heavily on layout-aware extraction that works across formats (PDFs, scans, even weirdly formatted financial docs) with structured outputs you can push directly into downstream workflows. Not a black box either—you get to QA the extracted fields, add validations, and build rules on top, which makes it more flexible for production environments.\n\nWould love to hear if you've tested OCRFlux with documents like scanned tax forms or bank statements. That’s usually where tools either shine or totally break.",

I mean type in chatbox 'file upload please'(please is unnecessary, but feel good :)) if you wanted a file upload to there. It is no-learn system.  \nThese basics, a kind of 'commands', are on the site. But i think you do not need to learn it, because you just type what you want to do. Of course the functions of Jetelina are shown on the site as well.\n\nEven thought, someones demand me its documents. I intended to create Jetelina as no-learn system, but people would like to learn it.:)  \nSo back to the title, do you think so?",

The tone of the phrases you use aren’t phrases I’d use in casual conversation with anyone who gave any remote interest in a project I was working on. \n\nThe progression on the site from install, to setup, to usage, to advanced things is good (or at least the idea you have), but you need to have the easiest install method possible to get those casually interested up and running. Think of writing a series of instructions that only take a single page, and include all the basic steps, including installing a DBMS. DO NOT tell me to go look up instructions on my own if I need it to use your thing; that comes off as disrespectful. Reading that sentence alone made me not ready to recommend your project to anyone I know. \n\nHaving videos is good, but text is needed too, especially if there’s commands you can copy and paste to help with install or configuration. People learn in different ways, and you need to cater to that if you want to attract an audience.",

    "selftext": "We’ve been building AI agents and ran into a recurring problem:  \nEvery time we updated a prompt, model version, or tool config things broke silently. Outputs changed, costs spiked, JSONs got malformed, and we only caught it after things hit production.\n\nSo we built [**agentcheck**](https://github.com/hvardhan878/agentcheck) a Python library that lets you **trace, replay, diff, and assert** the behavior of your AI agents.\n\nIt works like [VCR.py](http://VCR.py) or Jest snapshot testing, but for LLM workflows.\n\n# What it does:\n\n* **Trace** full agent runs (prompts, tool calls, LLM outputs)\n* **Replay** them later — locally or in CI\n* **Diff** behavior between runs (model change? prompt tweak?)\n* **Assert** expected behavior (output must contain key string, etc.)\n\n# Why it matters:\n\n* AI agents are non-deterministic and fragile\n* Prompt and model changes are frequent\n* Most teams have zero testing infrastructure for LLMs\n* CI testing is prohibitively expensive without mocking\n\n# Example use case:\n\n1. Run your agent and save a trace: agentcheck trace python run\\_agent.py --output trace-v1.json\n2. Modify your prompt or switch model\n3. Replay: agentcheck replay trace-v1.json --output trace-v2.json\n4. Diff or assert: agentcheck diff trace-v1.json trace-v2.json agentcheck assert trace-v2.json --contains \"order ID\"\n\n# GitHub:\n\n[https://github.com/hvardhan878/agentcheck](https://github.com/hvardhan878/agentcheck)\n\nWe’d love feedback and early contributors especially if you’re building LLM agents or working on prompt testing, CrewAI, or multi-model evals.",

    "title": "Frontend Book Wizards Needed: Help Modernize LazyLibrarian’s UX and UI (Ajax / Bootbox / JavaScript... or similiar)",
    "selftext": "**TL;DR** LazyLibrarian is a mature, GPL-licensed self-hosted solution that **automates ebooks, audiobooks, and magazine downloads** — but its UI is showing its age. The core team has **6 000+ commits of Code goodness** and is now looking for fresh **front-end talent (Ajax / Bootbox / JavaScript... or similiar)** to level-up the user experience and keep the project accessible to new readers.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 What LazyLibrarian already does\n\n* **Tracks authors and series.** It pulls metadata from HardCover, OpenLibrary, LibraryThing, and Google Books.\n* **Finds the bits for you.** When you flag a book as “Wanted,” it hunts Usenet (sabnzbd, nzbget, etc.), torrent clients (Deluge, qBittorrent, Transmission, more) for an NZB / magnet or direct providers like Anna's Archive, ZLibrary and LibGen.\n* **Processes downloads automatically.** Cover art + metadata goes into a Calibre-compatible `.opf` next to each file.\n* **Speaks OPDS/RSS.** Perfect for feeding KOReader, Marvin, or any ebook app that understands open catalog feeds.\n* **Keeps magazines current.** It can watch specific titles and grab the newest issues as soon as they appear.\n* **Docker-everywhere.** Official multi-arch images from LinuxServer.io make installs painless on x86\\_64, ARM HF & AArch64.\n\n\n---\n\n## ⚡️ Why the front-end needs love\n\nThe project’s Python back-end is rock-solid, but the **Bootstrap-era UI** struggles with enhanced UI Elements and UX simplicity.\nEspecially for the following issues:\n- Table inline editing (for example Magazine Issue Numbers)\n- Centralizing Language Settings\n- Working with modals and frontend actions\n- Add Progressbars (x item of y)\n- Background tasks (minimize and maximize dialogs/modals)\n- Alerts for the user if task is completed\n- Add inline progress/status updates via Ajax instead of full-page refreshes.\n- General UI and UX candy - go wild! :)\n\nThe maintainer u/philborman is very responsive and open for feedback.\nCheck out for open tickets and issues here:\n* https://gitlab.com/LazyLibrarian/LazyLibrarian/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&first_page_size=100\n* r/LazyLibrarian\n(check also the ticket comments)\n\n---\n\n## 👩‍💻 We’re looking for contributors who…\n\n* Speak **vanilla JavaScript** fluently and aren’t afraid of ES6 modules.\n* Can wire up **Ajax** calls to a Flask/CherryPy JSON API.\n* Know **Bootbox.js** (or can swap it for a modern modal library without breaking flows).\n* Have an eye for accessibility & responsive design (Bootstrap or any non-breaking drop-in replacement).\n\n---\n\n## 🛠  What you’ll get out of it\n\n* A **real-world OSS project** with active users (r/LazyLibrarian has 3300+ members).\n* CI/CD feedback on every merge request through GitLab pipelines.\n* Mentorship about the project from the lead maintainer (who hangs out in the GitLab issues & r/LazyLibrarian).\n* Instant karma from people whose ebook backlog just got prettier. 📈\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to dive in\n\n1. **Fork the repo** → `git clone https://gitlab.com/LazyLibrarian/LazyLibrarian.git`\n2. Spin up the dev stack: cd into the folder, `pip install -r requirements.txt`and `python LazyLibrarian.py` (defaults to port 5299)\n3. Check open UX/UI tickets\n4. Drop a note  on r/LazyLibrarian or comment on the issue on GitLab you want to tackle.\n5. Hack, commit, open a **Merge Request** — we review fast!\n\nYou can also try out the LSIO.io LazyLibrarian Docker image:\nhttps://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-lazylibrarian/ \n\n---\n\n### ✨  Let’s make reading ebooks, audiobooks and magazines delightful together!\n\nIf you’ve ever cursed a clunky “SickBeard-style” page from 2014, here’s your chance to fix one. Jump in, ship a PR, and help thousands of self-hosters read more with less friction. 👩‍💻👨‍💻\n",

        "body": "Very cool, I love it.\nSome suggestions Since the age calculator can give you even hours, it would be nice if it had an optional entry for the hour of your birth to give you a more accurate calculator.\n\nAlso I checked the calendar for Mexico since I'm from there, overall it is fine, I saw for instance that it was missing father's day that was June 15th but I don't know what's the source of the data. Also \"Día de muertos\" is translated as \"Día de los difuntos\" which is not what we call that day, these issues might be hard to change when everything is automatic, maybe changing the source of the data in case it can be improved like that.\n\nSomething that I could suggest to be added to the description of the Mexican calendar is to include a brief note explaining that the holidays listed on the calendar don’t always coincide with their actual anniversaries. For example, this year, \"Constitution Day\" was marked on February 3rd, even though the official anniversary is February 5th. Similarly, Benito Juárez’s birthday is marked on March 17th, but the actual anniversary falls on March 21st. The Mexican Revolution is listed on November 17th, while we actually celebrate it on November 20th.\n\nWhy the discrepancies? These adjustments are made primarily for the school calendars, holidays are often shifted to the nearest Monday or Friday to give the kids long weekends, rather than interrupting the school week, I know similar changes happen in other countries too, so maybe it could be added as a more general warning maybe. I hope this explanation is useful and makes sense for your project.",

    "selftext": "Hi Everyone,\n\nThis is a small little project I've been working on in my spare time to help me manage networking at work. I used this as a chance to kill two birds with one stone and also tried to brush up my webdev skills. I wanted to share this with the community because I benefited a lot from the open source community when I was younger and I want to try and be a part of it now that I am older.\n\nWhile this has CRM in the name it's really not intended for business use, its designed very specifically for personal use. You can find more of a writeup on my Github page but the gist of it is, its a tool for you to track people in your lives and how long it's been since you shot them a message (represented by a healthbar). You can mark people as contacted in the card and leave comments about your last interaction.\n\nThere is no communication intergration yet. I investigated Whatsapp intergration but sadly automating that is quite difficult. There are more features I want to add down the line but my goal is to keep using it and adding features when they pop up. In general , I want to keep it focused on what I want it to do which is make me more strategic with how I network. I don't want this to be some big bloated piece of software.\n\nI might eventually add email intergration but it's not really something I need since in my country most people communicate with Whatsapp. But I might look into it\n\nFeatures:-\n\n* Adding contact cards\n* Mobile Support\n* Relationship HP (How Long since you messaged them)\n* Card Styling and Filters\n* A login system for an admin\n\nIt's a Flask Webserver with a SQLite databse. I tried to keep everything as light as possible so it should be pretty easy to get it setup and running. It's fully opensource and I have no intention of ever changing that. I have a full time job that's not coding related so this is a side project.\n\nLink: - [https://github.com/Fhy40/clarionCRM](https://github.com/Fhy40/clarionCRM)\n\nI want to learn how to properly release, document and support projects so all I ask is you share your feedback with me cause I really want to improve both this project and my skills.",

    "title": "I'm building a tool to explore Kobo eReader data — before it disappears",
    "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI just started working on a small library called kobo-db-tools. If you’ve ever dug into your Kobo’s KoboReader.sqlite file, you’ll know it stores a lot of stuff — reading sessions, brightness changes, dictionary lookups, bookmarks… all in plain text.\n\nThe issue is that most of that data, especially reading sessions, gets wiped out during sync. So I wanted to find a way to read it, decode it, and eventually keep it around for longer.\n\nRight now, the library can:  \n– parse reading session events like timestamps, pages, and duration  \n– extract brightness changes, both auto and manual, with levels  \n– read dictionary lookups  \n– basic support for bookmarks, though that part is still early\n\nYou can also set up a SQL trigger on the device to prevent Kobo from auto-deleting these events. It’s optional but useful if you want to keep long-term stats.\n\nThe main goal is to provide the Kobo data in a clean and organized way, making it easier to perform deeper and more interesting analyses from a behavioral and usage perspective. This can be especially useful for people doing research across multiple devices, or for learners tracking their reading habits while studying a language.\n\nWhat I’m planning next includes:  \n– exporting everything into a new local SQLite database to preserve your stats over time  \n– supporting merging data from multiple devices or backups  \n– allowing export to CSV or JSON  \n– maybe building a CLI or TUI later if there’s enough interest\n\nIn the future, once the library is more mature, it could enable new insights into reading patterns, habit formation, and personalized recommendations based on long-term data — turning raw logs into meaningful knowledge.\n\nFor now, it’s just a library. But I’d love any feedback or ideas if this sounds interesting — especially if you’re into local-first tools or like exploring your devices.\n\nHere’s the crate on crates.io: [https://crates.io/crates/kobo-db-tools](https://crates.io/crates/kobo-db-tools)  \nAnd the repo on GitHub: [https://github.com/mfdaves/kobo-db-tools](https://github.com/mfdaves/kobo-db-tools)",

Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing\n\n    If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than\n    a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this\n    License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the\n    Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no\n    longer subject to the conditions in sections 3 through 5.\n\nWhich is an interesting way of preventing (A)GPL/commercial dual licensing. However, this license also says:\n\n    \n    If the Derived Work includes material licensed under the GPL, You may\n    instead license the Derived Work under the GPL.\n\nAs far as I can tell as someone who isn't a lawyer, it would seem that if there's some code under this license that you want to include in your GPL/commercial dual licensed software, you can just create a Derived work that combines `copyleft-next` code with `GPL` code, and then use that derived work (now under the GPL) in your GPL/commercial dual licensed software.\n\n~~That aside, I don't see what solution this is trying to solve that isn't already solved by the MPLv2. This section allows you to use code under any FOSS license, which includes permissive licenses:~~\n\n~~However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material\ngoverned by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the\nrelease date of this License, provided that compliance with such\nother license would not conflict with any conditions stated in other\nsections of this License.~~\n\n~~So then if I create an MIT-licensed project with some code from this `copyleft-next` license, if someone uses my MIT-licensed project that incorporates this code in their proprietary project, they only need to release the source of the code under the `copyleft-next` license as far as I understand.~~\n\n~~In my understanding this is functionally identical to how the MPLv2 works.~~\n\n~~So... This license seems mostly redundant and a form of license proliferation, with a dual licensing nullification that would be interesting if it wasn't trivially bypassable like it is currently.~~\n\nIgnore the second point, that section is I think just saying that any FOSS license is inbound compatible",

When you need to find a cable you can search this up in Homebox and it will track it to the Garage, down to the specific box (if you wanted). \n\n  \nAlternatively, if like me you have a box and wonder what should be in it, you can scan the QR code on the box and see the immediate list of items within. \n\n  \nHope that this helps, but feel free to give our Demo a shot also! :)",

    "selftext": "Hi /r/opensource! \n\nI built [ArchiveJump](https://github.com/dhrm1k/ArchiveJump), a browser extension that automatically redirects article links from major news sites to their archived versions on Archive.ph.\n\n\nTHE PROBLEM: Reading articles from sites like NYT, WSJ, The Atlantic, etc. often hits paywalls. While Archive.ph exists, manually copying URLs and searching is tedious.\n\nTHE SOLUTION: ArchiveJump detects when you click article links from 15+ supported news sites and either: - Searches Archive.ph for existing archived versions, OR - Jumps directly to the latest archived version (toggle option)\n\nKEY FEATURES: \n\n• Smart detection (only article links, not homepages)\n\n• Two modes: search archive.ph OR jump to latest version \n\n• Easy toggle controls via popup \n\n• Manual \"jump\" button for any page \n\n• Visual feedback (blue/green notifications)\n\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: - Vanilla JavaScript, Manifest V3 - Works on Chrome/Edge - No data collection, settings stored locally - Content script + popup interface\n\n\nThe extension respects sites' content while leveraging publicly available archives. It's particularly useful for research, fact-checking, or when you've hit monthly limits.\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/dhrm1k/ArchiveJump\n\nInstall: Load unpacked in Developer Mode (Chrome Web Store submission coming)\n\nWould love feedback on the UX, additional sites to support, or feature suggestions!\n\nNote: This tool uses Archive.ph, which archives publicly available content. Please respect publishers by subscribing if you regularly read their content.\n\n\nEdit: ArchiveJump is now live on Mozilla Firefox Addons - https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/archivejump/.",

If you're building agents and need a simple way to add a human safety net, I hope you find it useful.\n\n[https://github.com/iris-networks/loopgate](https://github.com/iris-networks/loopgate)",

    "title": "We just open-sourced SmythOS, an agentic AI framework inspired by operating systems",
    "selftext": "Hi Folks,\n\nLast week we released [SmythOS](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre), a new open-source framework designed for building robust, production-grade AI agents.\n\nSmythOS takes architectural cues from operating systems. It treats agents like processes and provides modular access to external services (auth, vector databases, storage, cache) through connectors. This makes it easy to swap providers without rewriting agent logic.\n\nSecurity and access control are built into the core. Each agent operates in its own data scope, or within a shared \"team\" scope if collaboration is needed. Data isolation, role-based access, and optional encryption are part of the foundation.\n\nHighlights:\n\n* Fluent SDK with structured abstractions\n* CLI tools to scaffold projects and run agents\n* Visual editor (to be open-sourced later this year)\n\nWe're releasing under the MIT license. While documentation is still in progress, the repo already includes useful SDK references and examples to get started.\n\nOn the roadmap:\n\n* Additional vector DB and storage connectors\n* Remote code execution via Node.js sandboxes and serverless\n* Container orchestration (Docker and LXC)\n* Advanced chat memory customization\n\nWe’re looking for feedback from the community. What do you want from frameworks like this? What’s missing in your current tooling?\n\nIf this sounds interesting, check it out and consider giving the repo a star or fork:  \n[https://github.com/SmythOS/sre](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre)",

    "title": "Is the EUPL's network distribution clause circumventable?",
    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand how the EUPL's copyleft works in the context of its \"network distribution\" clause, given its \"Compatible Licenses\" clause and appendix.\n\nOn the one hand, the EUPL has a relatively strong copyleft clause: \n\n    will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence\n\nIt also has a clause that defines distribution in a way that includes network use, like the AfferoGPL:\n\n    — ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending, renting, \n    distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making available, online or \n    offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its essential functionalities at the \n    disposal of any other natural or legal person.\n\nHowever, it also permits the following:\n\n    If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof \n    based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence,\n    this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible \n    Licence. ... Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict \n    with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence     \n    shall prevail.\n\nThis is fine for most of the licenses on the list, which largely don't have obligations that conflict with the EUPL, and so the network distribution clause would remain in effect:\n\nMPL, EPL, etc\n\nHowever, the EUPL also includes in its list of compatible licenses the GPL v2 and v3. This is relevant because the GPL contains the following text:\n\nv2:\n\n    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\nv3:\n\n    You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n    rights granted or affirmed under this License.\n\nThis seems to mean that the EUPL's \"network distribution\" clause is in conflict with the GPL's \"further restrictions\" clause. This means that, per the EUPL's own terms, *\"the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail\"* since the *\"obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence\"*. The GPL obligates the licensor not to impose additional restrictions on top of what's specified in the GPL, of which the EUPL's network distribution clause is an additional restriction, and so by the EUPL's own terms, choosing the GPL as a compatible license would result in the EUPL's own \"network distribution\" clause being dropped.\n\nIf this is the case, then to circumvent the network distribution clause, all you would need to do is choose the GPL as the \"compatible license\" for the code you'll add to the EUPL, and how you have a copy of the originally EUPL code under terms that don't obligate you to treat network use as distribution.\n\nIs this a known hole in the EUPL? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nThe [EUPL FAQ](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/faqs) seems to think that they have closed the ASP/SaaS-loophole in a similar way to the AGPL. But if their network distribution clause is trivially bypassable, did they really close the loophole? If what I wrote above is correct, it would seem that the EUPL writers ought to fix this in a v1.3 of the license.",

        "body": "Maybe. Not entirely clear.\n\n\nPerhaps a court would find that the network copyleft effect is indeed circumventable by creating a derivative work, where the modifications are substantial enough for you to obtain joint copyright, allowing you to pick s Compatible License instead. The important part here is that the modifications might have be substantial enough to qualify as \"another work\" – some jurisdictions like Germany have a fairly high bar for copyright in modifications.\n\n\nHowever, perhaps a court would find that \"another work licensed under a Compatible Licence\" cannot be authored by yourself (as this would blatantly subvert the intent of this license), but that this compatibility clause merely allows you to combine two third-party works (one EUPL, one GPL).\n\n\nWhen creating such a derivative work with a mix of licenses and using it yourself, it's also worth pointing out that the EUPL clauses do not act as a GPL \"additional restriction\" on you. This GPL clause prevents licensors from restriciting licensees in a manner that is incompatible with GPL goals – this preserves the GPL \"brand\". You cannot restrict yourself, you either have the right to do something or you don't.\n\n\nSo hypothetically, we might need four independent actors to perform sich EUPL network copyleft laundering: author of the EUPL work, author of the GPL work, author of the Derivative Work combing the EUPL+GPL works (resulting in GPL for thr Derivative), and finally the licensee performing the Communication.\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe EUPL does actually address this point when they discuss relicensing:\n\n\n> To be legitimate, the use of the compatibility clause must result from necessity: using it for the sole purpose of relicensing a copy of the original work would be a copyright infringement.\n\n\nand\n\n\n> other obligations, in particular resulting from the definition of Distribution (Article 1 of the EUPL related to the coverage of Communication to the public or SaaS, like the AGPL) and the obligation to provide access to the source code will persist in addition to those of the Compatible Licence, because none of the compatible licenses are in conflict with the EUPL on these specific points: for example, the GPL does not mandate to provide access to the source code in case the software is performed remotely, but it does not prohibit it.\n\n\nPersonally, I don't think that's argued correctly. I'd agree with you that an EUPL+GPL combination will run into issues around further restrictions. This cannot be handwaved by claiming that the GPL does not *require* SaaS use. However, that FAQ entry does seem applicable in case a single person creates the Derivative Work and then thinks they themselves are no longer bound by EUPL terms.\n\n\nI think the correct approach would have been to make use of GPLv3 section 13, so that a derivative work of EUPL and GPL components would result in an effective AGPL license for the work as a whole. Even if that's not explicitly required by the EUPL, this might be the least risky approach for creators of the Derivative Work in question.",

So this is just an interpretation of the license. And even then, how would you prove whether it was out of necessity or not?\n\n> some jurisdictions like Germany have a fairly high bar for copyright in modifications.\n\nMaybe this is the crux of the issue: differences in copyright law between Europe and the US?\n\n>  Even if that's not explicitly required by the EUPL, this might be the least risky approach for creators of the Derivative Work in question.\n\nTo be honest, there is so much confusion and ambiguity around this that I see no reason why anyone would risk choosing to make a derivative under a \"compatible license\". It's a shame cause I think the concept of the EUPL is interesting but the execution is so poor in its ambiguity that it makes it far less useful for ordinary FOSS devs. If you need a team of lawyers to understand a license, it's not really generally FOSS anymore, it's \"FOSS for those who can afford a team of lawyers\".",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using Obsidian for a while now, but syncing notes across multiple devices and operating systems became a challenge I wanted to solve without paying for a monthly subscription. I also found that existing Git-based plugins for Obsidian still assume users are familiar with version control, which isn’t always the case.\n\nSo I created Ogresync, a free and open-source tool that automates the entire sync process using Git and GitHub behind the scenes, but without requiring any Git commands from the user. Instead of opening Obsidian directly, you launch Ogresync, which syncs your vault, opens Obsidian, and syncs again after you finish editing, ensuring your notes are always up to date.\n\nI know there are Git community plugins for Obsidian, but I realized they still assume you know Git well enough to resolve issues if something goes wrong. My goal with Ogresync was to hide all of that complexity so anyone can keep their Obsidian notes synchronized without stress.\n\nI’d love feedback from other open-source enthusiasts. Does this kind of tool sound useful? Are there ways you think it could be improved?\n\nHere’s the repo if you’d like to check it out or contribute:  \n[https://github.com/AbijithBalaji/Ogresync](https://github.com/AbijithBalaji/Ogresync)",

    "selftext": "Hey all, I made a post a while back asking for Caddy Configs in r/selfhosted as I've been putting time into developing a UI for Caddy. The reception was overwhelming and beyond motivating to continue working on it and whilst I wasn't able to get as much progress in as I initially wanted, I did decide to publish what is currently there with more features planned over the upcoming months!\n\n**CaddyManager** is a web UI for managing multiple Caddy Servers - Currently in an \"Alpha\" state, being that all features that are currently in there *work,* but will become better in the near future! \n\n***Screenshots can be found on the*** [homepage](https://caddymanager.online) ***of the website!***\n\n# Standout features\n\n\\- **Connect to multiple Caddy Servers** and pull their configs, update them, redeploy them\n\n\\- **Basic templates and form based configuration**, create a new reverse proxy, api gateway, load balancer and more through a form instead of lines of json/yaml/caddyfile code\n\n\\- **API keys**, securely interact with the backend of CaddyManager through RESTful apis, securely utilising API Keys - there's also docs available.\n\n\\- **Multi-user**, the system is multi-user, with two distinct roles (right now), admin and user.\n\n\\- **Audit logging**, as this is something that I've already started using in an enterprise setting, audit logging was a must-have. Track actions throughout the system with ease!\n\n# How to deploy\n\nAre you an adventurous user that wouldn't mind trying some new things? Then backup your caddy setup, open up port :2019 (or something else) in your server and head over to the example compose stack: [https://caddymanager.online/#/quick-start](https://caddymanager.online/#/quick-start)\n\n**3 docker containers**, yeap, that's currently what it needs! We'll be running MongoDB as database, a backend service, and a frontend service. If you already have a MongoDB running, feel free to tie it into that.\n\nFor an example Docker Compose, go here: [https://caddymanager.online/#/quick-start](https://caddymanager.online/#/quick-start) \\- default user and password are: \"admin\" and \"caddyrocks\"\n\n# Information\n\nGithub repository here: [https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager](https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager)  \nQuick website here: [https://caddymanager.online/#/](https://caddymanager.online/#/)  \nDockerhub here: [https://hub.docker.com/u/caddymanager](https://hub.docker.com/u/caddymanager)\n\n# What's next?\n\nPlenty of features I wanna work in, but I think the key focus next few weeks will be on accessibility and UI, mainly a proper dark mode as well as screen-reader capabilities, as well as fixing bugs that people might find.\n\nAfter that I'll start working on some more exciting features like a proper dashboard, bulk actions, configuration versioning, git/s3 import/export, OIDC and more intelligent templating.\n\nFor the current roadmap: [https://caddymanager.online/#/roadmap](https://caddymanager.online/#/roadmap)\n\n# Known issues\n\nI'm still making a proper list but for now:\n\n1. when deploying you have to manually set the backend IP and expose it to the user instead of the frontend proxying it itself to the backend. \n2. No dark mode is a problem\n3. Forms and input fields are in need of some css lovin'\n4. Sometimes you have to \"refresh\" datasources after logging in as the last error is still preventing them from showing.\n5. Code cleanups, quite a bit of leftovers from \"in-between\" work/bugfixes still in the codebase, some touchups are needed here.\n\n# Time investment\n\nAs with any open source project, this stuff can be a bit scary, however, we're starting to use this tooling at my work as well, which gives me some more resources to work with! The project itself will get continued development until the full feature list from the roadmap is built in - after that it'll either go into maintenance mode or will receive continued development based on community engagement!\n\nThe project is MIT licensed, so feel free to fork, but would love to hear people's ideas and thoughts, feel free to fill up the Github issues! [https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager/issues](https://github.com/caddymanager/caddymanager/issues)\n\n\n\nps. This is my first time open sourcing anything - feel free to drop any feedback you might have, or things I should have done and missed, googling for \"what to do when open sourcing your project\" only takes you so far..",

Even when documents have folds, irregular spacing, or distortions\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nFolks that build document processing applications need to reorder and rearrange bounding boxes. This open-source library is intended to do that.\n\nThis library is not intended for serious production applications since it's very new and NOT battle-tested. People who are willing to beta test and build new projects on top of this are welcome to try and provide feedbacks and suggestions.\n\nGithub - [https://github.com/doctor-entropy/bbox-align](https://github.com/doctor-entropy/bbox-align)\n\nPyPI - [https://pypi.org/project/bbox-align/](https://pypi.org/project/bbox-align/)",

    "title": "I made a web-based serial interface for air quality sensors – fully open source and JSON-configurable",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been working on an open source project called **PolluSensWeb**, and I’d love to share it here in case it’s useful to others or sparks some collaboration.\n\n**PolluSensWeb** is a web-based serial interface for reading binary data from air quality sensors over  UART-USB bridges. It runs entirely in the browser using the Web Serial API — so there's no need to install anything. Just open the page, connect your device, and you're good to go.\n\nWhat makes it different from many serial monitor tools is that the whole interface is **driven by a JSON configuration** file. That means you can define the serial port parameters, binary frame structure, signal names, positions, checksums, and even how often a command should be sent to the sensor.\n\nSome key features:\n\n* Uses a JSON config file, you may also loaded your own JSON (template on GitHub)\n* Supports binary data frames with custom format and checksum\n* Can send commands once or periodically to the device (e.g. for polling sensors)\n* Displays raw hex data in log\n* Live charting of selected values using Chart.js\n* Designed to be fully modular, so the core logic could be reused in other sensor or device UIs\n* CSV download for parsed data\n\nI originally built this to debug and visualize data from my own open hardware air quality sensor project (Pollutag Node2), but I made the tool general enough so it can be used with pretty much any sensor that talks over serial and sends structured binary data.\n\nYou can try it here (if you have a serial sensor):  \n**Demo**: [https://wespeakenglish.github.io/polluSensWeb](https://wespeakenglish.github.io/polluSensWeb)\n\nOr explore the code and config examples:  \n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/WeSpeakEnglish/polluSensWeb](https://github.com/WeSpeakEnglish/polluSensWeb)\n\nIt's still a work in progress, but it's functional and should be easy to extend. More sensors come. As for now it is 12 sensors in default conf. If you're into environmental monitoring, web-based interfaces, or embedded sensor projects, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Feedback and contributions are very welcome.\n\nHackaday project: [https://hackaday.io/project/203369-connect-any-uart-pollution-sensor-via-browser](https://hackaday.io/project/203369-connect-any-uart-pollution-sensor-via-browser)\n\nThanks for reading!",

    "selftext": "# Introduction：\n\nProject link: [https://github.com/xiao-zaiyi/illa-helper](https://github.com/xiao-zaiyi/illa-helper)\n\nIf you find it helpful, please kindly give it a star.\n\n\"Immersive Language Assistant\" is a browser extension that uses a large language model to intelligently replace web vocabulary as the target language to achieve immersive learning. Core functions include AI intelligent translation (supporting 20+ languages), pronunciation learning (phonetic display, TTS reading, AI word meaning interpretation) and 7 visual styles. Developed with Vue3+TypeScript, supports Chrome-Edge-Firefox, and local processing of all data ensures privacy. The highlight is to realize gradual learning through the \"i+1\" theory, provide interactive floating frames, intelligent caches and cross-platform compatibility, helping users naturally improve their foreign language skills when browsing web pages.\n\n# ✨ Core Philosophy\n\nWe firmly believe that the best way to learn a language is through extensive exposure to \"comprehensible input,\" the famous **\"i+1\"** theory. This means content should be slightly above your current level—challenging but not incomprehensible. This extension aims to turn the entire internet into your personalized language learning material by intelligently replacing selected words with their translations in your target language, allowing you to naturally improve your vocabulary and language intuition while immersed in reading.\n\n**🎯 Project Highlights**: Features a complete pronunciation learning ecosystem with intelligent multi-language translation, including automatic language detection, phonetic notation, AI definitions, dual TTS support, and interactive tooltips for a comprehensive one-stop immersive experience from smart translation to pronunciation learning.\n\n# 🚀 Features\n\n# 🎯 Core Translation Engine\n\n* **Intelligent Language Detection**: AI automatically identifies webpage source language, no need for users to manually specify language type\n* **Intelligent Text Processing**: Uses AI large language models to analyze webpage content and intelligently select vocabulary suitable for user proficiency levels\n* **Precise Replacement Control**: Precisely control translation ratio (1%-100%) with character-based calculation support\n* **Context Awareness**: Considers context and user level to select the most appropriate translation vocabulary\n* **Multi-language Support**: Supports 20+ languages intelligent translation (English, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Polish, Czech, Turkish, Greek, etc.) **theoretically depends on AI model capabilities**.\n\n# 🔊 Pronunciation Learning Ecosystem ⭐\n\n* **Interactive Pronunciation Tooltips**: Hover over translated words to view phonetics, AI definitions, and pronunciation features with intelligent positioning to avoid boundary overflow\n* **Dual-layer Learning Experience**: Phrases display interactive word lists, click individual words for detailed information with nested tooltip support\n* **Multi-TTS Service Support**: Integrates Youdao TTS (high quality) and Web Speech API (backup), supports British/American pronunciation switching\n* **Smart Phonetic Retrieval**: Automatically retrieves Dictionary API phonetic data with 24-hour TTL caching for optimized performance\n* **AI Definition Explanations**: Real-time AI-generated Chinese definitions for more accurate understanding with contextual analysis support\n* **Progressive Loading**: Display basic information first, then asynchronously load detailed content to optimize user experience\n* **Audio Caching**: Memory-level TTS audio caching, no need to regenerate audio for the same word",

    "selftext": "Longtime lurker and really happy to be writing this post. I'm excited to share a proof of concept I've been working on for efficient vector database distribution called Ragged. In my paper and PoC, I explore leveraging the MP4 video container format to store and distribute high-dimensional vectors for semantic search applications.\n\nThe idea behind Ragged is to encode vectors and their metadata into MP4 files using custom tracks, allowing seamless distribution through existing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). This approach maintains compatibility with standard video infrastructure while achieving comparable search performance to traditional vector databases.\n\nKey highlights of my work include: - A novel encoding scheme for high-dimensional vectors and metadata into MP4 container formats. - CDN-optimized architecture with HTTP range requests, fragment-based access patterns, and intelligent prefetching. - Comprehensive evaluation showing significant improvements in cold-start latency and global accessibility. - An open-source implementation to facilitate reproduction and adoption.\n\nI was inspired by the innovative work of Memvid (https://github.com/Olow304/memvid), which demonstrated the potential of using video formats for data storage. My project builds on this concept with a focus on CDNs and semantic search.\n\nI believe Ragged offers a promising solution for deploying semantic search capabilities in edge computing and serverless environments, leveraging the mature video distribution ecosystem. Also sharing indexed knowledge bases in the form of offline MP4 can unlock a new class of applications.\n\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any potential use cases you envision for this approach. You can find the full paper and implementation details \\[here\\](https://github.com/nikitph/ragged).\n\nThank you for your time fellows",

    "selftext": "I've been working on a project for the past two years called Anagnorisis. It's an self-hosted system that acts like a personal, local Google for all your household's media - music, photos, videos and notes. It can already completely replace services like Spotify if you have a big enough library of music you like to listen to, as it includes an intelligent recommendation service that takes into account your listening behavior and taste.\n\nThe core idea is to reclaim our data from cloud services and build a recommendation and search system that is 100% private and adapts to your personal tastes.\n\nThe whole system is built with Python (Flask, PyTorch, Transformers) and runs locally on your own machine.\n\nFor me, this started as a personal quest to build a spiritual completely local successor to Grooveshark's fantastic recommendation engine, which I've missed for years. It has since grown into a much broader tool that I use daily.\n\nI believe we need more tools that give us the power of modern AI without sacrificing privacy and ownership of our most personal data.\n\nI'd love to get your feedback and hear your thoughts.\n\n\n\nP.S. This post is a repost of the same thread from a couple of days ago that was removed by the moderation team as the project has not had an established license yet, so technically wasn't open-sourced. So I added an AGPL-3.0 license to fix this issue, I hope it will stay this time.",

    "title": "Introducing CLIPs! Context Link Interface Protocol.",
    "selftext": "I’m excited to introduce **CLIP** (Context Link Interface Protocol), an open standard and toolkit for sharing context-rich, structured data between the physical and digital worlds and the AI agents we’re all starting to use. You can find the spec here:  \n[https://github.com/clip-organization/spec](https://github.com/clip-organization/spec)  \nand the developer toolkit here:  \n[https://github.com/clip-organization/clip-toolkit](https://github.com/clip-organization/clip-toolkit)\n\nCLIP exists to solve a new problem in an AI-first future: as more people rely on personal assistants and multimodal models, how do we give *any* AI, no matter who built it, clean, actionable, up-to-date context about the world around us? Right now, if you want your gym, fridge, museum, or supermarket to “talk” to an LLM, your options are clumsy: you stuff information into prompts, try to build a plugin, or set up an MCP server (Model Context Protocol) which is excellent for high-throughput, API-driven actions, but overkill for most basic cases.\n\nWhat’s been missing is a **standardized way to describe “what is here and what is possible,” in a way that’s lightweight, fast, and universal.**  \nCLIP fills that gap.\n\n**A CLIP is simply a JSON file or payload,** validatable and extensible, that describes the state, features, and key actions for a place, device, or web service. This can include a gym listing its 78 pieces of equipment, a fridge reporting its contents and expiry dates, or a website describing its catalogue and checkout options. For most real-world scenarios, that’s all an AI needs to be useful, no servers, no context window overload, no RAG, no need for huge investments.\n\nCLIP is designed to be dead-simple to publish and dead-simple to consume. It can be embedded behind a QR code, but it can just as easily live at a URL, be bundled with a product, or passed as part of an API response. **It’s the “context card” for your world, instantly consumable by any LLM or agent.** And while MCPs are great for complex, real-time, or transactional workflows (think: 50,000-item supermarket, or live gym booking), for the vast majority of “what is this and what can I do here?” interactions, a CLIP is all you need.\n\nCLIP is also future-proof:  \nToday, a simple QR code can point an agent to a CLIP, but the standard already reserves space for unique glyphs, iconic, visually distinct markers that will become the “Bluetooth” of AI context. Imagine a small sticker on a museum wall, gym entrance, or fridge door, something any AI or camera knows to look for. But even without scanning, CLIPs can be embedded in apps, websites, emails, or IoT devices, anywhere context should flow.\n\n**Some examples:**\n\n* Walk into a gym, and your AI assistant immediately knows every available machine, their status, and can suggest a custom workout, all from a single CLIP.\n* Stand in front of a fridge (or check your fridge’s app remotely), and your AI can see what’s inside, what recipes are possible, and when things will expire.\n* Visit a local museum website, and your AI can guide you room-by-room, describing artifacts and suggesting exhibits that fit your interests.\n* Even for e-commerce: a supermarket site could embed a CLIP so agents know real-time inventory and offers.\n\nThe core idea is this: **CLIP fills the “structured, up-to-date, easy to publish, and LLM-friendly” data layer between basic hardcoded info and the heavyweight API world of MCP.** It’s the missing standard for context portability in an agent-first world. MCPs are powerful, but for the majority of real-world data-sharing, CLIPs are faster, easier, and lower-cost to deploy,and they play together perfectly. In fact, a CLIP can *point* to an MCP endpoint for deeper integration.\n\nIf you’re interested in agentic AI, open data, or future-proofing your app or business for the AI world, I’d love your feedback or contributions. The core spec and toolkit are live, and I’m actively looking for collaborators interested in glyph design, vertical schemas, and creative integrations. Whether you want to make your gym, home device, or SaaS “AI-visible,” or just believe context should be open and accessible, CLIP is a place to start. Also i have some ideas for a commercial use case of this and would really love a comaker to build something with me.\n\nLet me know what you build, what you think, or what you’d want to see!",

I'd love to see a mandatory version field plus a simple lastUpdated timestamp so clients can cache and only re-fetch deltas. Schema-org JSON-LD bindings would also let websites expose CLIPs with zero extra work; the markup is already there. For QR flow, consider baking in a short hashed ID that points to a signed payload, avoids stale stickers after content changes and solves tamper issues. For dev experience, a Typescript client that auto-generates strongly-typed hooks would lower the barrier; I can help with that. I’ve wired Zapier and PostgREST for quick context sync before, but APIWrapper.ai ended up my go-to once I needed clean AI-ready wrappers across vendors. CLIP feels built for the same simplicity: tiny, cache-friendly, and easy for any agent to grok.",

    "selftext": "When combined with a carte blanche CLA (one that allows the project owners to sublicense), copyleft licenses that would otherwise foster an open development process are turned into a weapon. By forcing external contributors to sign over copyright to the project maintainers, the maintainers don't have the same obligations to external contributors and users as external contributors have to the maintainers. This creates a power imbalance that is radically opposed to the spirit of open source, while masquerading as open source using a FOSS license (often the AGPLv3). Despite the license, project maintainers can take the code proprietary any time they want, since all the copyright has been signed over to them. External contributors on the other hand are bound by the copyleft and have no rights to future versions of the software if the maintainer decides to take the code proprietary. As you can see, the power imbalance is significant.\n\nThis doesn't apply when the CLA is used alongside a permissive license (for example, Chromium), since the license itself gives everyone the right to sublicense.\n\nSee https://isitreallyfoss.com/issues/copyleft-cla/ and https://keygen.sh/blog/weaponized-open-source/ for more info.\n\nFor these reasons I would encourage folks to avoid promoting and especially contributing to projects that use Copyleft+CLA.

Also defend against **malicious bots**, that's why an authentication module is included that requires a *proof of work*, solving a crypto-challenge, instead of actual credentials.\n* **Language and dependencies**: `C` (C11 + POSIX), dependencies `zlib`, `OpenSSL` (or compatible) and optionally `libpam` (for the PAM credentials checker).\n* **Target platforms**: Theoretically any POSIX (and \"POSIXy\") system. Specific support for BSDs (`kqueue` backend), Linux (`epoll` backend plus support for `signalfd`, `timerfd` and `eventfd`) and Solaris descendants (`event ports` backend).\n* **Current focus**: The last release focused on performance, greatly improving the maximum throughput by going for multiple event-handling threads, and also reduced the typical memory consumption.\n* **Future plans**: Vague. Need feedback. An idea might be to support asymmetric JWT token signing algorithms with persistent keys (e.g. reusing the private keys of existing TLS certificates), to allow simple and stateless load balancing of multiple running instances.",

Everything is written in pure C, built with a basic CMake setup, and has **no external dependencies**.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n    // Server sends \"hello\" to every client that sends a message \n    void server_message_handler(uint8_t* data, SwiftNetPacketServerMetadata* metadata) { \n        swiftnet_server_append_to_packet(server, \"hello\", strlen(\"hello\"));                   \n        swiftnet_server_send_packet(server, metadata->sender);\n        swiftnet_server_clear_send_buffer(server); \n    }\n\n**How you can help:** \n\n* Test on Linux: clone, build with cmake, and run the tests in /tests\n* Suggest improvements to the overall library or code clarity \n* Share ideas for future features\n\n**Thanks for checking it out! Ask me anything.**\n\n**Repo:** [**https://github.com/deadlightreal/SwiftNet**](https://github.com/deadlightreal/SwiftNet)",

Not sure if it'll help with other questions, but I'm currently using [CookieConsent](https://github.com/orestbida/cookieconsent) v3, and I like it because:  \n• there are three options/buttons on the banner (accept all, only necessary, custom settings), and three in the settings window (save settings, accept all, only necessary) – yes, I know it's required by law, but still not every cookie tool offers it,  \n• it's easy to add categories and cookie names (with description, expiration, domains – which I use for service name) for the settings window in the JS config file (though this may not be easy for a less technical person – I'm not sure who's your target audience),  \n• I can easily add a link to the settings window on my page,  \n• I can add links to cookie/privacy policies etc. on the banner (there's a dedicated space for them at the bottom of the banner).\n\nWhat some people may not like about CookieConsent, is that it block cookies on a script basis (and what if a script loads both analytical and marketing/advertising cookies?). In addition, I had to disable some other script (luckily, not used) that was blocking the function of CookieConsent (I don't know JS, and I didn't know what else to do than just disable it 😬).\n\nI remember there were also issues with Google reCAPTCHA, but I don't think any tool can solve them – if a visitor blocks all cookies or a category containing the \"\\_GRECAPTCHA\" cookie, reCAPTCHA won't load properly (at least that was the case with the site I added the cookie banner to).",

The OS isn't gonna stop working. The OS will stop actively supporting your specific device. That's not the same thing. At all. \n\nEven if it was, 10 years is a longer lifespan than the duration of time the vast majority of people keep their phones for. \n\nAnd even then - you can still use the phone. The phone won't just break for no reason after 10 years. It just stops receiving active support. But the specific version you have still works. It's just not up to date and won't receive active support anymore. \n\nThe crazy part ? Anything i said above **literally** doesn't even matter. Since it's opensource, you can use your tiny little hands, grab yourself a keyboard, fork the repo and keep it up to date yourself. That's the *__exact__* opposite of planned obsolescence.\n\nExpecting people to **actively** support ever single version of every single OS for every single device in existence from the invention of the phone to the end of the fucking universe, and calling anything that doesn't \"planned obsolescence\", is absolutely mad",

There is a news section for each project you create and when leaving comments on anything, you can tag other users.

    "title": "5 Simple Ways to Support Open Source Projects as a Non-Programmer",
    "selftext": "I receive this questions often after explaining to normal people that I write open-source-software. How can I help, but I am not a programmer.\n\nHere are 5 approaches:\n\n**1. Be a problem solver**  \nWhen you encounter an issue, don't just grumble;  report bugs with precision.   \nWe programmers genuinely appreciate detailed bug reports because they provide the clues needed to fix problems.   \nInstead of \"It doesn't work,\" aim for a clear, concise description: \"When I click X, Y happens, but Z was expected. I'm using version A on operating system B, and here are the steps to reproduce it.\" The more information you provide, the faster the programmer can help you.\n\n**2. Be an ambassador:**  \nYou tried it out and found and solved a problem?  \nShare your success! Document your experiences and helping others. Write a short guide, tutorial, or case study about how you used the software to solve a specific problem.   \n  \nPublish it on platforms like Medium, your personal website, or a relevant blog. Your real-world insights can inspire and inform countless other users.\n\n**3. Be a word finder:**  \nNot everyone writes code, but everyone can contribute to clear communication. If you have a knack for language, you can improve the project's documentation. This could involve translating texts into other languages, correcting typos and grammatical errors, or expanding existing documentation with more detailed explanations and \"how-to\" guides.   \n  \nAll you need is a GitHub account to suggest edits and improvements, making the software more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.\n\n**4. Be a supporter:**  \nSometimes, the simplest actions can have a significant impact. Give likes, star repositories on GitHub, or recommend the software to colleagues, friends, and your professional network. In a world where visibility matters, your simple endorsement can help counter trends and bring well-deserved attention to valuable open-source projects. \n\n**5. Be a user:**  \nUse open source wherever possible. Perhaps the most fundamental way to contribute. Every time you choose an open-source alternative, you're actively participating in the ecosystem. Your decision to use, explore, and rely on open-source solutions strengthens the entire movement, reinforcing the idea of collaborative development and shared knowledge.\n\nYou know more?

They prefer donations that come without requirements or small print, while my app says \"you will only get the money once this specific feature is delivered\". So devs prefer Patreon or donations.\n2. It allows users to change the direction of a project, or even fork it, into something closer to what they need. I think this bothers devs.\n\nWhat I mean is: I need a way to reach users, not developers. Users will put money into ideas, and that money will attract devs. I can't start with the devs. Devs like the app but they don't post anything, don't put money into it, and often feel even a bit pressured by the idea.\n\nDoes that make sense? I'm not sure if that's the case but that's the vibe I got from devs so far.\n\nGitHub login would be cool, true. And linking ideas to GitHub issues would also be nice.

    "selftext": "I had a conversation on the digital signage subreddit (not sure if links are allowed, but you can check my recent comments there). Some people said that large companies and government agencies avoid using open-source software in production.\n\nOne person said even tools like Linux, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kubernetes are rejected where they work because “open source means no accountability” (which made me wonder what do they actually use then?).\n\nI know that many companies offer paid support and licensing for open-source software like Red Hat, EDB, Redis Enterprise, and so on. But what surprised me was the claim that companies choose proprietary products over open-source just because they think open-source is too risky or hard to support.\n\nThat doesn’t really match my experience and knowledge.\n\nI’d really like to hear from anyone working in enterprise or government IT, or from vendors and integrators who have been part of these decisions. Maybe I’m missing something here.\n\n**UPD:** Here is the link to the discussion for full context\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalsignage/comments/1lh4y41/comment/mzcw0c2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalsignage/comments/1lh4y41/comment/mzcw0c2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

The issue is less the actual doing, but more about the legal aspect.\n\nBasically, somebody needs to sign a document saying \"I will take care of this! Our processes satisfy $RegulatoryFramework\".\n\nAnother example is testing. You need to document that the software is \"properly\" tested.\n\nFor propietary software usually the vendor does this. Why? Because otherwise the customer won't buy this software (because they legally can't use it for their medical product).\n\nHowever, for software developed by \"the community\" it's more complicated. Who would sign this form? There is no single legal entity that is responsible for it. You could find the main developer, but he probably has other things to do.\n\nI think the only solution is that the consuming company (e.g. my employer) does that and that's additional effort and risk.",

That whole industry is so bizzare, crazy how archaic the stuff in there can be. But I’ve grown to love it these past 3 years while running my closed source SaaS for it.\n\nAnyways I know some large companies will use OSS stuff if there are support contracts or other similar offerings you can purchase (assurance for them the OSS doesn’t get abandoned). Makes sense.\n\nIm a big open core fan myself (r/opencoresoftware) which I think can be a really nice middle ground for everyone involved. Assurances to the customer that the software isn’t abandoned, monetization for the vendor so they can sustain themselves.\n\nBut certainly in some huge tech companies like AWS or Azure OSS is EVERYWHERE. I’m pretty sure Linux Azure App Services are one of the most popular services on all of Azure, period. I use them extensively.\n\nEven in the dotnet community, that everyone used to hate on back in the old .NET Framework / Windows-only days (they are still suffering from bad reputation damage to this day) if you ask a generic person in r/dotnet what RDBMS to use, I guarantee like over 80% of them will say Postgres before SQL Server. 🤷‍♂️ and a lot of them work in enterprise systems.\n\nSo in my limited experience maybe it just depends… is the company scared of abandonware or misunderstand the GPL family of licenses? Someone else in here mentioned gross misunderstanding of the GPL licenses and I completely agree, my open core product has a whole doc page dedicated to explaining that.",

If its a choice of savng the company a million dollars by using open source, or hiring oracle, they hire oracle every time, because if something fails, it's on Oracle.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why opensource was able to establish itself.   Firstly, it happened first in Tier 1 tech companies, who are both massive and 'in the business' - with a ton of engineers on hand to pick through the source, whole data centres on standy, etc if the shit hits the fan. (Amazon, Google, Dell, etc)\n\nThe second is that companies like Red Hat (now IBM) and others,   sold service contracts that enabled accountability.   They were able to undercut the old vendors like Sun, DEC, SCO because the licenses were essentially free and they only charged maintenance.\n\n\nsource : old school corporate wanker.",

Sure, we support that natively, here is the adapter.\n\nYou want to read some info from the SAP ERP System? Go ahead, here is the adapter.\n\nOn the enterprise scale, this makes integrating sometimes hundreds of systems a lot more straightforward.\n\n\nHow is it at the company I work for (financial sector)?\nWe do use open-source, but we have to mark it and either buy support, like you said, from the vendor, or a company that offers us that service. \n\nHowever, I believe most “critical” systems, like the core databases are still mostly proprietary systems (like DB2 and Oracle).\nOften this is because of backwards compatibility or extended Support.\nMigrating a core-company database isn’t done overnight, so when you need to stay longer on an officially unsupported version, you can (very expensively) most of the time buy extra extended support.\n\nEdit: Some additional comments, now that I’ve read through other comments:\n\n1. Linux ≠ Linux, there are Linux distributions like Suse and RedHat that sell their own installations.\nWhile RedHat f.e is based on Fedora, RedHat offers (for us) security patches in under four hours, as we have legal requirements from our government.\n\n2. Legal & Standards: Aclot of proprietary software comes with “certification”. This is especially important for the medical and finance sector. \nBasically the software we buy from guarantees us,  that they did the certification and paperwork, so that the software we are buying is compliant.

I’d focus first on the product copy and pricing engines since they drive revenue fastest-train them on real storefront data, not just generic corpora, so tone and price bands feel native to each creator niche. For the chatbot, give it hooks into license keys and download logs; nothing tanks trust faster than a bot that can’t confirm a purchase. Caching storefront recs locally will also keep page speed high when traffic spikes. After messing with Shopify Functions for dynamic pricing, Stripe Radar for fraud flags, and APIWrapper.ai for spinning up quick custom endpoints, I’ve learned that clear fallback logic beats flashy ML every time-make sure every AI feature can gracefully default to a static rule set.

    "title": "Trying to start an Open Source Club at my university - How to explain to others the importance of this?",
    "selftext": "Hi there! Hope this post finds you well!\n\nHi everyone! I'm a computer science undergrad student in Brazil, and over the past year I’ve really fallen in love with the world of Free and Open Source Software. I’ve become a daily GNU/Linux user, and I’ve been diving into tools, communities, and ideas that completely changed the way I see technology. More than just using FOSS tools, I’ve realized that teaching others about them and contributing to open ecosystems is something I care deeply about.\n\nThe problem is: my university doesn’t have any kind of FOSS-focused initiative. Nothing about Linux, no open source projects, no install fests — not even talks about it. And that’s why I’ve decided to create a club from scratch. My goal is to bring together students who want to explore open source development, organize workshops and talks, contribute to projects during the semester, and most of all, spread the philosophy behind free software. I truly believe we need this kind of culture in academia — especially in public universities, where openness and collaboration should be core values.\n\nBeyond that, this project is also personal. It’s my way of taking leadership, sharing something I believe in, and building a portfolio that goes beyond class grades. But it’s been hard to explain that to some people — like my dad, for example — who doesn’t fully get why I’d invest time in something “voluntary” instead of focusing purely on paid opportunities. I see this club as an investment: in visibility, in networking, in technical skills, in initiative. But I’d love to hear from people who’ve done something similar.\n\nHave you started or joined an open source club during university? How did you get people on board? What impact did it have on your personal growth or career? How do you explain the value of open source to people who don’t quite get it?\n\nAny stories, advice, or encouragement would mean a lot. I’m just getting started, and I want to make this project something that lasts — not just for me, but for everyone who believes in technology that’s open, shared, and built together.\n\nThanks in advance!\n",

        "body": "Just a few remarks from my side:\n\nIt's great that you want to contribute and support the open source community!\n\nThere are many ways to inform people about this. You could give talks about open source (why it matters), you could create install parties where you support people e.g. installing linux and you could create a regular meeting where other interested people can share experiences (in German we'd call it a [Stammtisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stammtisch)\n\nAbout convincing people: I think it depends a lot who you want to convince. Some people care a lot about freedom, others don't. It definitely helps to know your audience and think from their point of view. For example sometimes you might want to emphasize \"free as in beer\" and sometimes \"free as in freedom\"\n\nTo me it also helps to have concrete examples. Open Source as a concept is very abstract. People might not even believe that it *can* work. Linux and Firefox are very concrete success stories. For computer science students git might be interesting.\n\nAlso, you don't have to convince everyone. It's better to convince 5 people who already are interested than 1 person who extremly sceptical.\n\nOne thing I would recommend is to check other existing groups. Maybe there are [linux user groups](http://lugslist.com/ctry/argentina.php?lg=en) in your city. Or there are student clubs relating to computer science. Or there might be open source groups in other universities.\n\nI never created my own club, but I was active in different groups in the past. The most benefit I got out if it was networking, sharing experiences and learning about new technologies. I think, even if you fail with your club you'll learn a lot that can help you in the future :)",

Universities need more open source communities (at least in Italy, where I'm located) where members can support each other, share their successful stories, and so on. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would start creating a small group of super-interested people and truly passionate about FOSS and open source values. Maybe you can start by hosting small events where you and your small community will show how to approach the open-source world. Most of the time, seeing someone passionate about what he's talking about can bring more people than it would be if you just try to convince them. You cannot convince someone who does not want to change their mind, but you can give them the right instruments to let them understand why it is important to support FOSS initiatives. I'm pretty sure that with the right \"emotional\" closeness, people will start to get passionate and will eventually support your community actively",

Look at the calendars of other groups nearby (and attend some if able). Of course there are the classic install fest and license discussions, but the way to build a community is to make it fun. You can talk about any free software. Refurbish ancient technology. Show off your horrible custom keyboard layout. Do live demos. Host a LAN party. Anything to keep it interesting.\n\nGood luck!",

    "selftext": "![img](by9amri4638f1 \"stunde lives in the menu bar and stays out of your way\")\n\nHey there, a few months ago, I was on the hunt for a tool to track time. This was to make it easier to see how much time I spent on university/freelancing projects. However, most of the software I found were either pretty old, or required online subscriptions and offered way to many features.\n\nThat's why I decided to write a small MacOS app **\"Stunde\"** *(which means hour in german)* that just lets you track time for different (sub-)tasks.

It allows people to really easily run shell commands from python like this:  \n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/JustinGirard/nodejobs/@master\n\n```  \n```python\nfrom nodejobs import Jobs\nJobs().run(command=\"sleep 5\", job_id=\"something_unique\")\n```  \nThats it really. \n\nThe reason I have used it all these years is because of its size, and the fact it doesnt need a background worker. It keeps all the longs in plaintext in the users directory, and does not add any bloat or complexity. Its perfect for when I want to run (or make sure) setup commands or other tools have run in a utility. I do things like hit database backup commands, or populate DB records, or run system cleaning commands, without having to fiddle with cron, or DevOps layers -- I can embed system logic into my applications, which can sometimes be elegant.\n\nI'm not sure if it will be useful to anyone, but I welcome all positive and negative feedback!\n\nNote: I'm new to the scene,  if there are better / more places to share this let me know!",

Additionally, the NGO is considering opening a second location.  \n  \nBasically, we're looking for a free (initially) or low-cost solution (investing a modest amount is not a problem) that can provide an inventory system, POS, and billing/accounting management.  \n  \nIn my research, I came across Odoo and ERPNext as possible options, but as someone inexperienced in this area, they seem very comprehensive and quite complex. What suggestions can you offer in this regard? Are either of these options viable, or are there better alternatives?  \n  \nWe can help with the setup and maintenance of the infrastructure, as well as the initial configuration, but I’m concerned that these systems might be too complicated for day-to-day use.  \n  \nThank you and best regards.",

I rarely interact with the inventory portion, and do not have any experience with any of the Frappe/ERPNext POS integrations. \n\nI settled on ERPNext (after switching from a desktop based proprietary software that became too expensive) as I found other open source offerings lacking for my use-case, overly complicated to setup, just plain not user friendly, or were either slowly \"phasing out\" the open source-ness of the package as a whole or worse, locking all but \"core\" features behind a paywall (looking at you, Odoo), and requiring _a lot_ work to build something yourself.\n\nI do not feel the system is overly complicated for day-to-day use. Granted I am _slightly_ more technically inclined in figuring out new software than most. But with any software there will be a learning period, especially if other software or even physical processes were used previously.\n\nERPNext is extremely flexible. Which can be a a blessing or a curse. When I setup my instance, i just needed to add a special invoice number scheme and port some home-grown reports. Beyond that it was ready to use after basic setup, like business name, address, customer info, etc. \n\nI would also suggest checking out this thread on /r/selfhosted to get thoughts from others who have setup a more complicated workflows with it. https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i84tq8/anyone_built_a_good_erpnext_based_system_at_a/",

The POS takes care of payments (cash or card), and the inventory system helps track what has been sold and what is still in stock.\n\nFor the POS, I would recommend a low-cost or free option that works on a tablet, like Square, Zettle, Shopify POS (they started online but now have a pretty good POS too). They are easy to set up, have low transaction fees, and do not require monthly subscriptions (except Shopify). It's easy to learn esp. when the shop is partly run by volunteers. \n\nFor inventory, many shops start out with handwritten tags or pre-printed barcodes. A simple next step is tracking things in Google Sheets or Airtable. Over time, most shops move to a software specifically built for secondhand inventory (e.g. Circle-Hand) which helps with pricing and keeping everything in sync, but it's not free. \n\nThe best setup will also depend on the country since there may be local regulations for the POS system, e.g.  TSE for Germany/Austria.",

    "selftext": "Meta researchers introduced LlamaRL, a fully asynchronous and distributed reinforcement learning framework. It is tailored for training massive LLMs on clusters ranging from a few to thousands of GPUs. They built LlamaRL entirely in PyTorch and implemented a single-controller design to simplify coordination. This design enables modular customization. Separate executors manage each RL component—such as the generator, trainer, and reward model—and operate in parallel. This asynchronous setup reduces waiting time throughout the RL pipeline. It also enables independent optimization of model parallelism and memory usage.\n\nLlamaRL’s architecture prioritizes flexible execution and efficient memory usage. It offloads generation processes to dedicated executors, allowing the trainer to focus exclusively on model updates. Distributed Direct Memory Access (DDMA) supports this offloading. It uses NVIDIA NVLink to synchronize weights in under two seconds—even for models with 405 billion parameters. The framework applies Asynchronous Importance-weighted Policy Optimization (AIPO) to correct for off-policyness caused by asynchronous execution. Each executor operates independently, leverages fine-grained parallelism, and applies quantization techniques to inference models to further reduce compute and memory demands.\n\nPaper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24034)",

Best option probably, would be to find some printhead that is kind of universal, that most than one brand uses so we can be sure it can be sourced for a long time, which I actually don't know if it exists, or a design that can adapt to different printhead models which then would require to do some reverse engineering to make a controller board for each, but even if that works, I guess  the brands could try to sue the people trying to use their printheads. So it's a very complex issue.\n\nI guess the best chance would be if we could convince a company to develop their printheads with an open source license or find a bunch of printer engineers willing to do the same, or even form a group to develop an open source 2D printer like RepRap did for 3D printers.\n\nAnd about interest, even if we use 2D printers just when we have to, most people still have those needs even if it's not a constant thing. Also personally, I would love to have a not so expensive printer that has great picture quality, the capacity to print photographs and posters for you and your friends would be a good reason for an open source printer.\n\nAlso a 2D printer could be relatively easy adapted to cut vynil and things like, like a Cricut.",

You can't import them. You can't just ignore the patents; you'd get sued into oblivion. Everybody would have to buy all parts that are generic and assemble that; plus make any parts that are special to your machine. And the stuff that's patented is wild, and far more far-reaching than anyone not familiar with what passes as a patent today would imagine.\n\nThe only way around the patent situation is just not building anything that was invented 2000 or newer (at least in my country). But then you'd also have 90s printing quality and reliability. And I'm old enough to remember the hatred I felt towards the family's BJC-2000 at this time.\n\nAs long as there is gutenprint and used hardware without software locks is available and can be kept in working condition, I don't see anyone building an open hardware printer.\n\nWhich sucks, frankly, but that's the way it is. It'd be way more realistic to make custom firmware for a series of printers; however, the moment this gets any traction at all, this also will be shut down immediately by manufacturers.",

But the second you want to get to something even remotely resembling something you would actually want to use on a daily basis, the complexities of 2d printing grow practically exponentially.",

    "selftext": "My first draft is done, and I think I'm ready to accept community feedback and good-faith constructive criticism to further revise the license into something that's actually usable, if not for widespread adoption but at least for niche projects willing to cement their commitment to a high bar for transparency, software freedom, user freedom and user protection, among other things.  \nI am uninterested in rebuttals involving gatekeeping responses regarding \"license proliferation.\" The state of copyleft software licenses is stagnant and we have not seen a new version of the GPL in almost 20 years. The once radical Free Software foundation has become institutionalized and slow. Many threats that the free software community community faces did not exist in 2007, we have entered an era of abusive and exploitative corporate data mining for algorithms, AI/ML, surveillance, etc.. Corporations seek to strip-mine the free software community without reciprocity, practically restrict freedoms granted by the GPL and other copyleft licenses through separate service or policy agreement. We need to put a stop to this as best as we can by drafting new licenses that assume the capacity and capability of bad faith actors seeking to loophole free software licenses, technically adhering to the letter while violating the spirit. THE SPIRIT OF FREE SOFTWARE SHOULD BE HARD CODED INTO THE LICENSE.\n\nSo..yeah that's all a bit rambly, I'll just let the license speak for itself:  \n[https://paste.rs/tyBKV.markdown](https://paste.rs/tyBKV.markdown)\n\nIn its current state, the Zmax Inalienable Rights License serves as not much more than a thought experiment, and a provocation for evolution of free software. I am not a lawyer, and the many of the terms outlined in the ZIRL are likely unenforceable as it currently stands. I strongly recommend against using this license on your projects until we've all come together to harden the license, refine it, and make sure it has good legal standing. Although by its nature, many of the ideas are radical and legally untested and will need to be challenged in court to set legal precedence. \n\nIn the interest of full transparency, since I am not a lawyer, and not particularly good at writing, I heavily utilized AI to draft the specific language contained within the license, however the spirit of the license, the ideas and philosophy behind it, are 100% a result of my core principles as someone who was raised in the free software AND the punk rock communities from toddlerhood. I spent weeks nitpicking at various LLMs over every word contained within, even so, there are likely many mistakes contained within the document that are artifacts of not being attentive enough when reviewing AI generated output.\n\nI'm looking forward to any feedback and revisions that may come from the post, let the discussion begin! :)",

Organizations with more than 500 employees using ZIRL software in production must deposit [...]\n\nI somewhat wonder if this would conflict with point 5 of the [OSD](https://opensource.org/osd). It's specifically setting terms on persons/groups, but not specifically limiting rights, just setting requirements. Not sure if there's something like this in an existing FOSS license.\n\n> Obligation of AI Transparency. If you systematically extract The Software's source code, algorithms, or behavioral patterns for use in AI/ML training datasets, you must license that extracted data collection as a Derivative Work under the terms of this license. Any commercial AI/ML models trained on datasets containing such ZIRL-derived extractions must make their training methodologies publicly available. \n\nThis may touch on point 6 of the OSD. It's targeting specific use and setting requirements that are quite a bit beyond the scope of the software use itself (for scope: referring specifically to the training methodologies bit). There's also the wider problem right now that those consuming for AI don't appear to think license terms matter if things are publicly accessible. \n\n> Obligation of Anti-Circumvention (Blue Hat Clause). \n\nI quite like the intent of this one. I havn't though about the specific text to fully understand possible practical complications, but the general idea seems to solve some common issues I've observed. I also like the \"Interpretation\" section, something like that could have really helped some of the current legal battles going on with the AGPLv3 (although i do wonder if there's legal practicality issues with broad interpretation guidance like that).",

    "selftext": "Hello r/opensource! About a year ago I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ap0phs/i_made_a_python_pdf_form_library/) about an open source project I have been working on for about 5 years called PyPDFForm. It is a Python library that specializes in PDF form manipulations, providing essential functionalities such as inspect/edit form fields, filling forms, creating form fields, and many more.\n\nThe project received some very positive feedback from the community and has been evolving since then. Right now it's at about 14k monthly pip installs and I'm constantly getting new issues opened for different requests for the library. And because of the rise of its usage there are some groundbreaking major changes needed to happen to the library in order to address some of its legacy problems.\n\nSo it is my pleasure to announce that, just this morning, PyPDFForm has released its v3.0.0 major update. I wrote [a long paragraph](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/news/2025-05-24/) explaining why V3 is necessary. But here I will highlight some of the key changes in it:\n\n1. Complete native PDF form filling. This is the legacy issue that V3 fixes. Instead of what used to be a watermark based approach, now every PDF form filled using PyPDFForm will be the same as if being filled by hand.\n2. Best compatibility with Adobe Acrobat you will find from any Python PDF library.\n3. Best PDF font support you will find from any Python PDF library. You can bring any font in the form of a TTF file and PyPDFForm will make sure it gets embedded and usable for PDF form text fields.\n4. The ability to create/fill image and signature fields. This is also something that to my best knowledge no other Python library provides.\n5. About 30% performance improvement.\n6. A new logo! I think it resonates perfectly with the name PyPDFForm.\n\nIf you find this interesting, feel free to checkout the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm), its [PyPi page](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDFForm/), and its [documentation](https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/). And like always, I hope you guys find the library helpful for your own PDF generation workflow. Feel free to try it, test it, leave comments or suggestions, and open issues. And of course if you are willing, kindly give me a star on GitHub.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI wanted to share something I've been building over the past few months -  **Digler**: a command-line tool to scan and recover files from raw disk images or physical devices, even without filesystem metadata.  \nYou give it a disk image (e.g. from a forensic dataset) or a disk directly, and it carves out deleted files using signature-based recovery. You can then either recover them directly or mount the report like a virtual filesystem.\n\n**Why Digler?**  \nMost forensic and data recovery tools I’ve used are either too heavy (GUI-focused, complex setups) or too inflexible. I wanted something minimal, extensible, and easy to use directly from the terminal.\n\n# Key Features:\n\n* **File-system agnostic** carving (works even when metadata is lost)\n* **Scan → mount → recover** workflow (generate DFXML reports and mount them via FUSE)\n* **Plugin system** for adding new file format scanners (just drop a `.go` file into `plugins/`)\n* **Cross-platform binaries** (Linux, macOS, Windows.\n\nIt’s written in Go, and already supports a range of common file types (docs, images, audio, archives, etc). More formats and disk types are on the way.\n\n📦 GitHub repo: [https://github.com/ostafen/digler](https://github.com/ostafen/digler)\n\nWould love your feedback and ideas!\n\nI’d also really appreciate contributions — even just trying it out on test datasets and share your feedback.\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "**The problem:** You have critical secrets that need to survive years or decades, but storing them in one place creates a single point of failure. What happens if your hardware wallet breaks, your house burns down, or you simply forget where you hid your backup?\n\n**What we built - Fractum:**\n\nA tool that uses Shamir's Secret Sharing (the same math Trezor uses) to split your most critical secrets into pieces. You can store shares with family, friends, bank deposit boxes - anywhere. Need 3 out of 5 pieces to recover, but having only 2 pieces tells an attacker absolutely nothing.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/katvio/fractum](https://github.com/katvio/fractum)\n* Security docs: [https://fractum.katvio.com/security-architecture/](https://fractum.katvio.com/security-architecture/)\n\n**Real-world use cases for individuals:**\n\n* **Cryptocurrency seeds:** Split your hardware wallet backup across trusted family members\n* **Password manager exports:** Your LastPass/Bitwarden master vault backup\n* **Important documents:** Encrypted scans of wills, insurance papers, tax records\n* **Photo/video archives:** Family memories encrypted on external drives\n* **Personal encryption keys:** SSH keys, PGP keys you can't afford to lose\n\n**Why we went open source:**\n\nWhen your life savings or precious memories depend on a tool, you can't trust it to stay supported forever. Companies disappear, but math doesn't. Open source means:\n\n* No vendor can hold your secrets hostage\n* Community can maintain it even if we disappear\n* You can audit every line of cryptographic code\n* Works completely offline\n* Each share is self-contained with the full recovery app\n\n**How it protects you:**\n\n🔥 **House fire:** Shares stored elsewhere remain safe  \n🚌 **Bus factor:** Family can pool shares to recover your assets  \n🏠 **Theft/coercion:** Attacker needs multiple people in different locations  \n🤔 **Forgotten hiding spots:** Only need threshold number of shares  \n📱 **Lost devices:** Hardware wallet breaks, but shares let you recover to any new wallet\n\n**The math:** Built on Adi Shamir's 1979 algorithm - information-theoretic security that's literally impossible to break below the threshold, not just \"really hard.\"\n\n**Full disclosure:** We built this after almost losing our own critical keys. Figured other people face the same \"how do I safely store this forever?\" problem.\n\n**For the community:** Looking for feedback on the crypto implementation or additional personal use cases. Goal is something anyone can rely on for decades of secret security, regardless of what happens to vendors or maintainers.",

    "title": "Ethical Licensing Dilemma: How to Implement Geo-Political Restrictions (and Acknowledge Non-OSI Status)?",
    "selftext": "**Edit: I want to maintain its open-source status, but Edge's autocomplete betrayed me in the title.**\n\n  \n**EDIT: Thanks for all your opinions. I've decided to keep the current license. I will, however, put a banner at the top of the README. While this feels somewhat hypocritical – like publicly condemning harmful acts but taking no serious action – I believe it's the best approach for the OSS community. It helps make my stance clear and keeps things balanced....and hopefully, it will prompt some moral deliberation among People.**\n\nGood evening (Well, midnight in my time zone.)\n\nI'm a software engineer, and like many, I've been profoundly affected by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The scale of human suffering, particularly in Palestine, is overwhelming. From October 7, 2023, until today, the reported death toll from Israel's actions has surpassed 56,000 killed and 131,000 injured, including a disproportionate number of children and women. I view these actions as a horrifying campaign of genocide against the Semitic Arab Palestinian people.\n\nAs a mere software engineer, I feel a deep sense of helplessness and a killer guilt. I don't have direct means to influence policy or provide humanitarian aid on the ground, but I want to use what little agency I do have.\n\nI've developed a open-source audio processing engine library called [SoundFlow](https://github.com/LSXPrime/SoundFlow) a 6 months ago, it's designed to be a robust, extensible, and high-performance tool for various audio applications. My intention is for it to remain entirely free to use in the general sense of \"free beer,\" and I initially release it under the MIT License.\n\nHowever, given my stance on the current situation, I feel a moral imperative to prevent this library from being used in any way that could directly or indirectly support what I perceive as the perpetrators of this violence. **Specifically, I want to prevent commercial usage of SoundFlow within the State of Israel completely**. My goal is to ensure that my work, even if small, does not inadvertently contribute to or profit those involved in what I see as crimes against humanity.\n\n**Here's my dilemma, and where I need your collective expertise:**\n\nI understand that adding such a restriction (preventing commercial use in a specific region/country) means the license **would no longer be considered an OSI-approved Open Source license (like MIT)**. It would violate principles like \"no discrimination against persons or groups\" or \"no discrimination against fields of endeavor.\" I acknowledge this upfront – if I implement this, SoundFlow would become a \"source-available\" project with a custom, non-OSI license, not truly \"open source.\"\n\n**My questions to the community are:**\n\n1. **Drafting a Custom License:** If I choose to go this route, what's the best way to clearly and legally word such a restriction? How can I make it as unambiguous as possible regarding \"commercial usage within the State of Israel\"? (e.g., does it apply to companies registered there, people residing there, subsidiaries abroad?) I've considered something like:\n\n>Notwithstanding the general permissions, commercial usage of this Software within the State of Israel is strictly prohibited. This restriction is imposed in solidarity with the victims of the ongoing conflict in Palestine and to prevent any direct or indirect support to actions deemed genocidal. This includes, but is not limited to, usage by entities, corporations, or individuals operating or residing within the State of Israel for profit-generating activities, or any use that directly or indirectly benefits the State of Israel's economy or military.\n\nIs this too broad? Is it not specific enough? What are the legal pitfalls? My intention is not to prevent it across the entire Western world, however, as most of my users are European or American, and I'm confident most people in the Western world agree with my concerns.\n\n2.  Enforceability and Implications: What are the practical implications of such a clause? How difficult would it be to enforce? Would it drastically reduce adoption (which is a trade-off I'm willing to consider, but want to understand)? What are the common challenges with geo-political license restrictions?\n\n3.  **Alternative Approaches:** Given that this breaks the \"Open Source\" definition, are there more effective or legally sound ways to express my stance without modifying the core license? For example, would simply including a very strong statement in the \\`README.md\\` or a \\`NOTICE\\` file, while keeping the MIT license, be a more impactful or less problematic approach? My goal is impact and ethical alignment, not necessarily legal battles.\n\nI'm genuinely seeking advice, examples of similar ethical clauses (even if controversial), or experiences from those who've navigated complex licensing or ethical dilemmas in software development. This is a sensitive topic, and I appreciate constructive feedback on the licensing aspect.\n\nThank you for your time and insights.",

Your released software is published with the old license. You can't really change that. In case the situation changes significantly you would have to change your license back.\n* To my understanding you would have to sue violating entities to enforce your license. Since law in most cases is national, you might have to sue in Israel itself in front of an Israeli court.\n* Personally, I'm really not a fan of abandoning open source for such political issues. I get that this topic is very important to you, but if everybody did that it would be the death of open source... I really wonder whether that's the area where your actions are the most impactful.",

[From the guy who wrote the OSD/DFSG](https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review_lists.opensource.org/2019-February/003951.html):\n\n\n> Sorry, I concur this violates OSD #6. That was written with the\nexample of an anti-apartheid license which remained in force after the end\nof apartheid and discriminated against innocent people.\n\n\n(I think Perens is confusing OSD #5 and #6 here, but that's not the point. The point is that well-intentioned clauses can have unexpected consequences.)\n\n\nI'd also like to point out that licenses have to be good for a hundred years. A lot can change in that time. Copyright typically persists for the life of the author + 70 years, but the value of software drops to practically nothing within 1 to 15 years. This is causing a lot of grief for efforts that try to preserve cultural works like games that have been abandoned by their owners. An interesting alternative is shown by the Business Source License, which automatically converts to an Open Source license after a predefined span of time.\n\n\nI am not happy with the outcome that the Open Source community tends to prefer ultra-permissive licenses that knowingly ignore any ethical concerns (copyleft licenses like GPL are also ultra-permissive for the purpose of discussing ethics). While we might hope that our software is used more for good than for evil, we cannot know. However, there wouldn't be an Open Source ecosystem if such restrictions were common.",

Backwards of how I usually understand these things. And this does take some of the ideas of Postel's Law in to consideration.\n\nWhen it comes to humans, any kind of humans, in any kind of system of organization for any kind of human activity, you are always better off being\n\n1. Specific\n2. As unlimited as possiblea. As specific as possible in any limitations regarding both type of limitation and to whom it applies\n\nFor the same reasons I oppose the death penalty: You \\*\\*can not be sure\\*\\* you are correct in your assessment, and it is better to\n\n* \"allow/enable/overlook\" some you would not have if you were aware\n\nthan it is to\n\n* \"disable\" some you would allow if you were aware\n\n, if that makes sense. Not universally applicable because context matters in every situation and every situation is different but I think in your case it makes sense. It really isn't worth the worry in the grand scheme of things. While I argue all things are related, and they truly are, your audio code has very little to do with violent conflict. So while all things are related *it is best to not make them more related than they actually are* unless we really want to create a literal international global oroboros domino effect where some dude sneezes and 30 days later the entire planet gets sucked into a black hole - for an intentionally ridiculous example. In other words the days are strange and times are chaotic and stressful, we shouldn't intentionally be making them more so. When at all possible try to keep things positive and within appropriate context. Personally good music is my go to to keep my mind... uh where it should be, fwiw\n\nBasically when it comes to restrictions of your software - or for example something like financial sanctions - unless you can be sure you are not going to have collateral damage of innocents, you probably should not add the restrictions. Because if you negatively impact innocents those people who previously would likely be on your side - ie against those who you are intending to affect negatively - they very well may decide that actually those people have a point, you kind of are an asshole. So you will create more division.\n\n\\---\n\nedit: Just adding extra links for personal convenience don't mind me\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1kcbq7a/comment/mq923p3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1kcbq7a/comment/mq923p3/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/USAFacts/comments/1lirm8r/comment/mzlpc6y/](https://www.reddit.com/r/USAFacts/comments/1lirm8r/comment/mzlpc6y/)",

And over the time I have seen that there is no such CLI package/tool which can help you kickstart your go project. There is alot of repetitive task of creating the project folder structure downloading the dependences and more. So to make Gophers' task easier I built a CLI tool that helps you in generating Go folder structure, download required packages and setup projects based on different template like api server, cli app. You can easily feed it a config yaml file or input via flags and it will configure a scaffold of your preferred type of project. It has lot of starter configurations like db setup for web service, docker, magefile and many more. Check out the package in Go official package repository.\n\nWill appreciate your feedback and also I am looking for contributors to scale this package, for contributing checkout the CONTRIBUTING.md in the github repo: \n[Gocrafter](https://github.com/ErebusAJ/gocrafter)  ",

    "selftext": "Hey Folks!  \n  \nI recently published an NPM package called 'stringzy' — a lightweight, zero-dependency string utility library with a bunch of handy methods for manipulation, validation, formatting, and analysis. The core idea behind stringzy is simplicity. It’s a small yet powerful project.\n\nThe entire codebase has now been rewritten in TypeScript, making it more robust while still keeping it super beginner-friendly. Whether you're just starting out or you're an experienced dev looking to contribute to something neat, there’s something here for you.\n\nI want to grow this project and scale it way beyond what I can do alone. Going open source feels like the right move to really push this thing forward and make it something the JS/TS community actually relies on.\n\nWe already have some amazing contributors onboard, and I’d love to grow this further with help from the community. If you’re looking to contribute to open source, practice TypeScript, or just build something cool together — check it out!\n\nEverything’s modular, well-documented, and approachable. I’m happy to guide first-time contributors through their first PR too.\n\nYou can find it here:\n\n📦: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/stringzy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stringzy) (NPM site)\n\n⭐: [https://github.com/Samarth2190/stringzy](https://github.com/Samarth2190/stringzy) (Github)\n\n\n\nDiscord community: [https://discord.com/invite/DmvY7XJMdk](https://discord.com/invite/DmvY7XJMdk)\n\nWould love your feedback, stars, installs — and especially your contributions.

A great fit for Lambda.\n\nWe’ve seen many screenshot APIs (ours included) explore serverless early on, but eventually run into scaling or complexity ceilings - some pages just don't render reliably in constrained environments.\n\nAt Urlbox, we moved to Kubernetes years ago for more control and long-term stability. Screenshot One made a similar move more recently.\n\nIf you ever hit the limits of this approach, we've shared a guide to scaling a Puppeteer screenshot API on Kubernetes:\n\n👉 [https://urlbox.com/guides/kubernetes-website-screenshots](https://urlbox.com/guides/kubernetes-website-screenshots)\n\n(You could do the same with Playwright - though based on our experience, I wouldn’t recommend trying to scale it with Selenium.)",

    "selftext": "Hello all, I'd love your feedback on a project I just completed an email alternative, open message protocol: Openmsg.\n\nI was fed up with email spam (aren’t we all?) and decided to build an alternative: Openmsg is an open, decentralized, cross-platform messaging protocol that anyone can implement.\n\nIt’s now live on GitHub along with a full website for documentation and setup guides.\n\n[https://github.com/Openmsg-io/version\\_1.0](https://github.com/Openmsg-io/version_1.0)\n\n[https://www.openmsg.io/](https://www.openmsg.io/)\n\n**Spam-Free by Design**\n\nThe core of Openmsg is permission-based messaging. One user cannot connect with another without explicit permission via a one-time pass code. After the connection (handshake) is made, the two users can message each other.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf User A wants to message User B, User A needs not just User B’s address but also a one-time pass code that User B provides.\n\nWithout a valid pass code, the connection attempt is silently rejected — no spam, not even spam requests.\n\n**Secure Handshake & Auth Flow**\n\nThe pass code is only needed once — during the initial handshake:\n\nA handshake securely exchanges auth codes and encryption keys.\n\nAfter that, messages are encrypted, timestamped, and hashed using the shared auth code.\n\nThe recipient server:\n\nReconstructs the hash to confirm authenticity, freshness (within 60 seconds), and message integrity.\n\nVerifies the sender’s domain by performing a callback to the domain in the senders address — ensuring the message was really sent from there.\n\n(Addresses look like this: 01234567\\*domain.com Where 01234567 is a numeric user ID, and domain.com is the hosting server node.)\n\nThis design prevents message spoofing, replay attacks, and the misuse of leaked auth codes.\n\n**Easy to Host**\n\nThe protocol in language-agnostic. The examples I have are currently in PHP.\n\nAll you need to setup is a database and a few scripts:\n\nA setup script initializes your tables (or create these manually).\n\nConfig files define your server settings.\n\nA small handful of files handle sending and receiving messages.\n\nIf you're not using PHP, the protocol is language-agnostic — it can be implemented in any language.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, if you have any ideas or suggestions (I have a roadmap of features I would like to introduce)\n\n[https://github.com/Openmsg-io/version\\_1.0](https://github.com/Openmsg-io/version_1.0)\n\n[https://www.openmsg.io/](https://www.openmsg.io/)",

To allow this, the document needs to be detailed, concise, eliminate ambiguities that might occur and provide a clear code independent way of implementing this (generally for specs like this that is, some specs might limit language choice due to needing control of lower level constructs). A good measure of a spec like this would be if you give it to 2 completely different Devs to implement the client and server side with different languages, and then get them to chat to the other (so client to server).\n\nSomething else I'd like to point out, PGP (or at least it's successor https://www.openpgp.org/) sounds kind of like this system, but built ontop of email, so although it doesn't eliminate spam because there is no hard mechanism to reject non PGP signed emails (fully transparent, I've neither read the spec in it's entirety not used it so I could be wrong), you could easily add a script to enforce it as a rule, which would have the same effect, with the added backing of cryptographically strong verification of the identity of the person (well, as strong as the parties protect their keys 😅).",

A pass code is used just for the initial handshake.\n\n After that the two users are connected by sharing an auth code and and encryption key. When one user messages a connected user, the message is encrypted using the shared key, and a timestamped hash is created using the shared auth code. The receiving user  verifies the message hash using the shared auth code.\n\nIf auth codes are leaked, they are useless to any other servers or domains (see updated post) hence why they would not need rotating. (However there is the option to rotate them)",

The site initiates a handshake (secret auth codes and encryption keys are exchanged) and can message you securely from then on — no email or external communication needed.\n\nIf you want to message a friend, yes, you'd still need to share your Openmsg address and pass code with them — just like you'd share your email or phone number.\n\n**Isn’t this just reinventing WhatsApp or Telegram?**\n\nNot really. Openmsg is meant as an alternative to email, not social messaging apps.\n\n\\-Email is open but spam-prone.\n\n\\-Messaging apps are closed but still allow unsolicited messages or connection request.\n\n\\-Openmsg is open and spam-proof — no one can contact you without explicit permission, and your address is useless even if someone sells your details (ie they cant sell your Openmsg address on to spammers) because to anyone else your Openmsg address is worthless on its own. A spammer cant even send you a connection request.\n\n**Do I need to re-authorize every message?**\n\nNo — the one-time pass code is only needed at the start.\n\nOnce two parties connect, they exchange private auth codes and encryption keys that allow for secure, ongoing communication without further setup.",

Now it can dynamically bulk load SSL certificates from disk and apply per domain, without any configuration. All you need is to set up a path fro certificates .\n\nIt's full async, high performance, modern reverse proxy with some service mesh functionality with automatic **HTTP2, gRPS,** and **WebSocket** detection and proxy support.\n\nIt have built in **JWT** authentication support with token server, Prometheus exporter and many more fancy features.\n\n100% on Rust, Built on top of **Cloudflare's** fantastic library: [**Pingora**](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora) . My recent tests shows it can do **130k** requests per second on moderate hardware.\n\nPrebuilt **glibc** and **musl** libraries for **x86\\_64** and **aarch64** from are available in [releases](https://github.com/sadoyan/gazan/releases) .\n\nIf you like this project, please consider giving it a star on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/sadoyan/aralez)!

I've been working on this package for more than 10 years now, but I'm about to release the new 5.0 version, which brings many significant changes and new features, so I consider these as still being in their early stage.\n\nTo make it short, Jaxon will allow the developer to build Ajax applications with UI components like React, Angular and the likes do, but in PHP on the server. The biggest advantage of doing so is that the application services can be injected directly into the UI components. No need for api calls through the network, and thus no security or authentication issues to deal with.\n\nThe first thing I would like to get help for is this fork of the well-known Adminer database admin tool: https://github.com/lagdo/dbadmin-mono. This is actually a monorepo with all the packages of the project, as well as a docker compose file to start a demo and scripts to populate sample databases with datasets freely available online.\n\nI would also be very happy to have some feedbacks on this package, also built with Jaxon: https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-supervisor. It's an admin dashboard for Supervisor, the process manager. https://supervisord.org.\n\nThis other package also needs some help: https://github.com/jaxon-php/jaxon-flot. It provides a PHP api to build graphs, and Jaxon based UI components to display them with a Javascript library. The PHP api needs to be enriched, support for more Javascript libraries would also be welcomed.\n\nThe last point on which I need help, is to have some ideas about useful things that can be built in the WordPress ecosystem using such a library.\n\nThanks in advance.",

These data are relatively large (\\~1-2GB for long context) and are often evicted when GPU memory is not enough. In these cases, when users ask a follow up question, the software needs to recompute for the same KV Cache. LMCache is designed to combat that by efficiently offloading and loading these KV cache to and from DRAM and disk.\n\nAsk us anything!\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache)",

    "selftext": "We just released [pymsi](https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi) ([https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi](https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi)), a pure Python library and CLI utility for reading info from and extracting the contents of Windows MSI installer files. Existing options out there were less than portable (often Windows-only), and we wanted something that would work on all major operating systems with a Python interpreter, that minimized extra hassle for users to install.\n\nFeedback, suggestions, bug reports, or contributions are welcome! Starring the repository and helping spread the word to relevant communities/user groups would also be greatly appreciated.\n\nSome of the key features/highlights are:\n\n* Pure Python - no compilers or other platform-specific dependencies that add to installation complexity or limit portability, it should even work with Pyodide\n* Read MSI file information - summary info, tables, streams, files, validation data\n* Extract MSI file contents - unpack files contained in MSI packages, including from cab files using lzx compression\n* Use as a library or CLI tool - it's already being used as part of another project as a library, but after being pip installed it also provides a standalone \\`pymsi\\` CLI utility that can be used to inspect MSI files and extract their contents\n* MIT license - no viral license to worry about when using it as part of another open source library\n\nCurrently we are using it as part of another project (also open source) - having a library written in pure Python and a non-viral license were important factors that led us to creating pymsi. I'd describe the current state as functional, ready for people to play around with and use, but not production ready for anything mission critical. In particular contributions that improve the CI tests would go a long way towards increasing confidence in it being stable!\n\nAnyway, check it out and I look forward to hearing any feedback!",

There's still some scenarios and categorisation questions to work through (things like non-mandatory binary blobs for example) but those are in discussion and I hope our lines of categorisation can become more solid over time.\n\nThere will always be opinion & personal beliefs in regards to the categorisation, and what's considered FOSS overall, but even if you don't fully align with how the site categorises things I'm hoping it should still provide value in the information we attempt to find and display during reviews, like licensing issues and funding sources etc...\n\nThe site itself is open source on Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/danb/isitreallyfoss",

    "title": "With the possible TikTok ban in 90 days, I built a tool to back up 1000s of videos (no watermark, fully automated)",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! Not sure if this helps folks here, but I figured I’d share just in case.\n\nDuring my internship, I had to back up over 3,000 TikTok videos for a work project. Online tools didn’t work well ... most crashed, got blocked, or left watermarks. So I made my own script that:\n\n* Bulk downloads TikTok videos automatically\n* Saves clean MP4s without watermarks\n* Handles errors + retries failed ones\n* Exports a list of failed downloads for review\n* Is super easy to use, even if you’re not into coding\n\n# Simple Steps\n\n**1.** Go to a TikTok profile in your web browser, open your browser’s developer console, paste this snippet, and hit Enter:\n\n    (async () => {\n      const scrollDelay = 1500, maxScrolls = 50;\n      let lastHeight = 0;   \n      for (let i = 0; i < maxScrolls; i++) {\n        window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);\n        await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, scrollDelay));\n        if (document.body.scrollHeight === lastHeight) break;\n        lastHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;\n      }\n    \n      const posts = Array.from(\n        document.querySelectorAll('div[data-e2e=\"user-post-item\"] a[href*=\"/video/\"]')\n      );\n      const rows = posts.map(a => {\n        const url = a.href.split('?')[0];\n        const title = a.querySelector('[data-e2e=\"user-post-item-desc\"]')?.innerText.trim() || '';\n        return { title, url };\n      });\n    \n      const header = ['Title','URL'];\n      const csv = [\n        header.join(','),\n        ...rows.map(r => `\"${r.title.replace(/\"/g, '\"\"')}\",\"${r.url}\"`)\n      ].join('\\n');\n    \n      const blob = new Blob([csv], { type: 'text/csv' });\n      const dl = document.createElement('a');\n      dl.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n      dl.download = 'tiktok_videos.csv';\n      document.body.appendChild(dl);\n      dl.click();\n      document.body.removeChild(dl);\n    \n      console.log(`Exported ${rows.length} URLs to tiktok_videos.csv`);\n    })();\n\nThis snippet auto-scrolls your profile and downloads all video URLs to a CSV file named `tiktok_videos.csv`.\n\n**2.** Clone my downloader tool (if you're new to GitHub, just download the ZIP file directly from the repo):\n\n    git clone https://github.com/AzamRahmatM/Tiktok-Bulk-Downloader.git\n    cd Tiktok-Bulk-Downloader\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n**3**. Download & install from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to check “Add Python to PATH.” if you find an option during installation.\n\n**4.** Copy the URLs from the downloaded CSV into the provided file named `urls.txt`.\n\n**5.** Finally, run this simple command (Windows):\n\n    python src/download_tiktok_videos.py \\\n      --url-file urls.txt \\\n      --download-dir downloads \\\n      --batch-size 20 \\\n      --concurrency 5 \\\n      --min-delay 1 \\\n      --max-delay 3 \\\n      --user-agent \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)…\"\n\nThis will download all the TikTok videos into a neat folder called \"downloads\".\n\nCheck out the full details on my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AzamRahmatM/Tiktok-Bulk-Downloader). But you don’t need to unless you want to dive deeper. Feel free to ask questions, leave feedback, or suggest features. I hope this helps someone else save a bunch of time",

Generally, if you're being provided a service/value, and you're not paying with money, you're probably paying in other ways (lock-in, using your data, etc...).\n\nIf you really want to use free services like google, but want extra privacy, you could maybe look at encryption options (so you encrypt your content client side and theoretically google can't then access or look at that content) but it's extra management/handling and, from your post, you'd want conveneince too.",

That's it. I took a look at my Beelink T4 Pro's power supply, it's 24 W, thus the top energy consumption would be 17 kWh per month, or around $3 considering the average US price of electricity. Realistically, even less, since it's gotta be idling most of the time. And when you're at your own home, you'll sync with it at max speed possible through your own LAN.\n\nAnother possibility would be combining a free web hosting that has CGI and such with some fitting application (it will have to use protocols that the hoster allows you to use, not anything that exists in general, so it'll probably have to made do with HTTP or WebDAV), it'll also be free, but the only downside is that you'll have more limited disk space (5-10 Gb) than you said you needed (15).\n\n>  I also don't want to rely on physical hard drive backups, because let's say I've been writing for an hour and need to rush off somewhere before I can make a backup, that lost hour of work could be invaluable stuff.\n\nAs far as speed of transfer is concerned, you cannot beat a directly connected drive.

    "title": "My open-source project: NetHang - A Weak Network Testing Solution Better Suited for Internet Products",
    "selftext": "**NetHang** is a web-based network quality simulation software tool based on the Linux platform. Other common names for similar tools include: weak network testing tools, network impairment tools (network damage testers), or network traffic control tools. NetHang primarily targets products with high real-time network requirements, mainly including RTC products (real-time audio/video communication, online conferencing, live streaming with co-hosting, etc.), AI Agent software (software that interacts in real-time with large-scale models over the network), and it can also be used to test the performance of congestion control algorithms and link stability.\n\n### Horizontal Comparison of Network Impairment Tools\n\nSimilar network impairment products mainly include:\n\n**Software Solutions:**\n- **Linux TC / Netem**: Linux kernel component\n- **Apple Network Link Conditioner**: Official Apple developer toolkit supporting iOS and macOS platforms\n- **Clumsy**: Open-source project supporting Windows platforms\n- **Comcast**: Open-source command-line tool running on Linux\n\n**Hardware Solutions**: Vendors like Spirent, HoloWan, and PacketStorm. These hardware network tools typically focus more on throughput and stability testing, making them more suitable for industries such as telecommunications equipment manufacturers, operators, or cloud service providers. These are not discussed in this article.\n\nThe main reasons for developing NetHang from the observation that existing software or hardware weak network tools have certain shortcomings in meeting the needs of last-mile network performance testing for internet products. These shortcomings are primarily reflected in the following aspects:\n\n1. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: This issue mainly affects whether the same weak network testing standards can be applied to measure and evaluate a product running on different platforms, as well as the accuracy of such evaluations. For software like Clumsy, which only support certain platforms, it is difficult to align testing methods, making it impossible to provide reliable and reproducible testing methods for weak network testing across platforms. Additionally, weak network testing software running on the test device itself is limited by the device's performance, which can even affect the device's performance, making it harder to obtain reliable test results. NetHang runs as a service on a Linux system acting as a soft router, theoretically providing identical network impairment services to all IP network devices connected through this router.[Imgur](https://imgur.com/VHAEM8V)\n\n2. **Built-in Network Models**: In widely used weak network tools, testers often face a complex set of network quality parameters, such as Packet Loss (various models like Markov, Gilbert-Elliot, etc.), Delay, Jitter (various distributions like Normal, Uniform, Pareto, etc.), Bandwidth Limit (combined with Queue-depth, Burst, TokenBucket settings), Accumulate-Burst (control of accumulated burst duration), and whether to enable Reordering, Corrupt (bit flipping), or Duplicate (duplicate packets). Combining these parameters to create reasonable weak network testing conditions is not an easy task, and in many cases, it is nearly impossible. Too often, testers use extreme conditions like 1000+ ms jitter with reordering to test internet products, which is not only futile but can also lead to problems if the product is overly optimized in this direction, compromising either weak network resilience or computational performance—a lose-lose situation. To address this, NetHang includes a set of built-in network impairment models based on extensive network probing results, which are reasonable and selectable. These models are continuously updated and expanded with richer and more accurate network models, improving testing efficiency while avoiding wasting effort on testing network conditions that rarely or never occur in real-world networks.[Imgur](https://imgur.com/nHX7YQI)\n\n3. **Custom Dynamic Network Models**: It is well known that last-mile networks exhibit highly variable characteristics due to diverse access methods, devices, load, signal strength, and competing traffic. NetHang allows users to customize and combine different network conditions using YAML syntax to create real-time dynamic network simulation conditions.\n\nBased on the above software tools, here is a summary comparison:\n\n| Feature                     | NetHang | Linux TC/Netem | Network Link Conditioner | Clumsy | Comcast |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------------|--------------------------|--------|------|\n| Cross-Platform Consistency  | ✓       | ✓              | ✕                        | ✕      | ✓    |\n| Built-in Network Models     | ✓       | ✕              | ✓                        | ✕      | ✓    |\n| Custom Dynamic Network Models | ✓     | ✕              | ✕                        | ✕      | ✕    |\n\n### Acquisition and Deployment\n- Project Homepage: https://nethang.org/\n- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/stephenyin/NetHang\n- Git Page: https://stephenyin.github.io/NetHang/\n",

There's a lot to be learnt but one of the things was collaboration with other people.\n\nI never found an open source project that fit my specific needs as I consider myself a beginner who only knows Java. I got into Android development and decided that I would focus on that and start a project and make it open source. That way I would still get the collaboration skills I really want and also be able to understand what is going on.\n\nI have developed a Note editor app for Android, it's very simple and basic. Add, edit and delete notes. I'm glad to say I've learnt so much from this journey, not only about Java but also git, github, markdown, etc. I feel like I'm ready to open up the project to everyone who'd be interested in checking it out. Your contribution or feedback would be very much appreciated. I would really like to learn from you.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/Andruid929/mind-android](https://github.com/Andruid929/mind-android)",

If you accept contributions under a permissive license, you may not be the sole copyright owner, but can still pretty much do whatever you want.

It does not take away copyright of the authors.\n\nIf you are the only author then you will still own the whole project and can do what you like with it: for example release it under a different licence, sell your ownership to someone else, etc.\n\nIf there are multiple authors you can't do things like that for the parts authored by others. You can only sell what you have ownership of.\n\nA CLA (and the various variants thereof) is a solution for this by establishing a legal contract between each author and yourself (or more precisely the entity listed in the CLA) to transfer ownership of their contributions to you.\n\nBecause this is a legal contract identifying a transfer of ownership you need to be able to identify who the ownership is transferring from and to. That entity is most likely a company (hence the builders asking for a LLC) but it could simply be a person (i.e. you).\n\nLike others I'd question why you want one, as it only comes into play if you want to accept contributions. If you simply want to publish your work then you just need a licence.\n\nFinally I'd add that most developers don't want to sign CLAs, not because they want to do a bait and switch on you, but because they don't want you to do a bait and switch on them. Just like you've done a lot of free labour to create your project, contributors are doing free labour to improve it. If they end up doing an extensive amount of work and sign a CLA what's to stop you taking their work and selling it (since you now own it).\n\nDepending on your concerns you might find some of the \"copyleft\" licences a better choice for your projects and do away with the CLA.",

Did you maybe confuse a CLA (contributor's license agreement) with the license?  \nTo clarify, a CLA's use is so you alone retain full copyright (and thus legal control) over a project. Unless you are a company, this is hardly necessary. IF you are (or belong to) a company: hire a lawyer to do this for you!  \n\nAnd the jurisdiction is very important actually, because while Open Source licenses make direct use of copyright and are internationally accepted, a CLA is more complicated. In some countries (eg Germany) it's actually impossible for an author to waive their copyrights, so idk if a CLA would even be legal here …\n\nAlso: there is a reason why CLAs are not popular, and many people (myself included) will outright refuse to work on such a project. If you try to attract contributors, it's not really a good idea.",

This isn't me being anti CLA, but if you're the sole copyright owner, then a CLA doesn't do anything. It's agreed to by any contributor, if you don't need contributors, then you don't need a CLA. For example I have my company has a project which is AGPL, but I own all the code myself so if I felt like violating the AGPL, nothing is stopping me. AGPL only protects contributors, and a CLA is essentially signing away some rights from contributors so you have more flexibility. CLAs are then inherently very complicated since you're essentially creating an agreement where they're allowing you to violate some of their licensed protections, which gets into fairly complicated contract law very quickly. It does not exist for peace of mind or to protect you from boring legal stuff. If you want that, use a permissive license like MIT. Heres the questions to ask\n\n\n1. Do you accept contributions. If you don't accept contributions, you can so whatever the hell you want, the license can't stop you. This also extends to accepting contributions that allow you to do whatever the hell you want (either by accepting code from permissive licenses like MIT or by them giving you personal permission. CLA is one way of them giving you personal permission.) \n\n\n2. What license are you using. CLAs are not very common with permissive licenses BC you can take their code include it in your project and do whatever you want with it anyways. CLAs in this case are not going to do anything since you already become the copyright owner to your repo\n\n\n3. What do you want the CLA for? To relicense (or allow for potential future relicensing if you change your mind) in the future? To be able to sell the contributions you get as proprietary code? Or maybe just to sell your own code including strong copyleft code (to prevent competing businesses from stealing some parts of your code while core functionality is open source.) Small projects rarely care about this, hence why every cla tends to be a large enterprise",

Because if not, you could just … not accept any.\n\nOr you just use the FSFE FLA template you linked above. It's still pretty free and doesn't strip contributors of all their rights like typical corporate CLAs. And it's neither complicated to read nor use, but probably as simple and ready-to-use as it gets. In the end you want to sign a legally binding contract between you and a contributors, so of course it's not as easy as clicking a \"CLA-button\" on Github. But it's not difficult either. Just fill out the form and let any contributors sign it prior to merging their code. If you don't fully understand it and/or want to be on the safe side: get a lawyer specialized in copyright in your country/jurisdiction.  \nEDIT: again, it is a *template*, so you can *change* it. In your case, the entity/company that should receive the exclusive rights is simple you, too. Nothing difficult about it.\n\nPS: if you want to retain full control – you mentioned Steam, so it's probably a game – you might want to NOT release some parts (like a logo) under a FOSS license but instead register trademarks (for the name, logo etc.).  \nThat said, there are some pretty successful games with open source code released on steam (even for money) that don't have a CLA, so it seems that doesn't pose huge problems.",

Contract law is complicated and the nature of what clas seek to do is necessarily complicated. It's not intended as a generic legal ease of mind thing. And you never even say what ease of mind you're looking for. Sometimes you're not arguing against a bot and sometimes you're just wrong lol. \n\n\nThe big thing that CLAs offer is that it formalizes IP transfer. Under permissive licenses this doesn't at all matter because contributions you receive are implicitly under the same liceane you publish it under. If it's under the MIT license, the committed code is itself licensed by MIT, so regardless of what happens, you can use that MIT license however is acceptable to the MIT license (which includes being able to use it in proprietary projects.) GitHub tos explicitly covers this. But in say the gpl, this can actually be kinda annoying. Maybe you want to sell it under a dual license, or as the project owner be able to sell it I'm a project that may technically violate the GPL. Most clas prevents this by saying that if you contribute code, the project owner actually owns the code and not you. Let's say that I have a project where I'm keeping the front end non GPL and the backend open under GPL, the GPL doesn't really allow this. By owning the IP, you can distribute the code openly under the GPL while yourself distributing it in an impure stack (actually an encouraged practice by Stallman) or by allowing you to dual license (maybe you can also offer a version available under a permissive license like MIT/Apache, or even proprietary licenses.) If you don't care about the possibility of either, you don't need a CLA. This is generally used by most large projects with complex legal and commercial requirements, owing to why CLAs are usually complex. \n\n\nThe other time CLAs are used is as a way of ensuring contributions are themselves something that contributors can legally contribute. However a DCO like what linux uses is usually totally sufficient for this use case. The reason why some projects use CLAs instead of DCO (ie kubernetes) is that CLAs are explicit formal contracts designed to cover odd edge cases, providing more comprehensive legal grounds as well as warranty disclaimers, mit.ent claims, non code related IP, etc. This is why they provide more legal protection than an implicit agreement like DCOs or just a license. But it's again the reason why CLAs tend to be complicated - it provides protection against complex legal action. \n\n\nIf your legal needs are simple enough you don't need to hire lawyers (ie patent attorneys or contract lawyers), then your legal needs are simple enough to not need CLAs. This is not anti CLA, it's the entire point of a CLA. It wouldn't be good explicit legal protection against complex legal issues if it wasn't itself complicated, this is why even most lawyers consider contract law its own beast. The one exception is if you for whatever reason feel the need to own the IP of contributors. This is also not inherently anti CLA, as GPL + CLA protects contributors to a very similar degree as permissive licenses like Apache/mit. Neither is a concern for most projects, but for those that genuinely need it, it's nice. You asked why there was no simple CLA, and this was just the answer to that. If you want to label any answer that doesn't roll over and agree with your misunderstandings of what a CLA even tries to do, then go ahead. They are a creature of complex contract law, not of simple copyright law. \n\nIf you insist on having a CLA, at least let us know what legal protection you want, or better yet, hire a lawyer. You never even mention what legal protection you want so even if we were legal experts we can't help you make a CLA. ",

What might happen is under GPL (or other copyleft licenses, but I'm not as familiar with the others so I'll just assume GPL) is that code contributed to you under GPL (assuming no CLA has been signed) is that you would not own any GPL code contributed to you. If you ever want to relicense or sell proprietary code, or almost anything even tangentially related, this is a problem BC it means you cannot accept that GPL code since you will be unable to use that GPL code in any application with even a hint of non gpl code (weaker licenses like MIT/Apache are just considered gpl code when shipped in GPL projects), and it does mean that any code you write that's dependent on that contribution will forever be stuck as GPL as a consequence. CLAs *do* actually fix this problem, but unless you have a reason to care about copyleft (and since you say you don't care about people taking your code without crediting you, it seems like you don't ), this problem is *also* solved by just using a permissive license like MIT or Apache. In this case, all code contributed has to be under a permissive license and you have full right to do with the code you recieve as you wish (I mean you still have to adhere to the license, but that's really easy with permissive licenses.)\n\n\nI highly recommend just reading the different licenses and see what they offer. GPL projects are highly restrictive so you might run into people complaining that it's a \"viral\" or \"infectious\" virus that steals your copyright rights (though to be clear, I'm a fan of GPL, the vast majority of my code is GPL, it seems like you aren't.) So called permissive licenses give project owners far more freedom in deciding how to use their project- if you decide to go proprietary tomorrow, nothing is stopping you. But the software isn't as \"free\" as a result (in the Stallman sense, not monetarily), which is what GPL offers",

If they can still use their own stuff thats fine, i'm willing / *trying* to open source it anyway.\n\nYou do not need a CLA to have their contributions be licenced for your use. In GitHub's terms and conditions, they explicitly call out that if you make a contribution to a repository then your contribution is licenced under the same licence as the repository (unless specified otherwise).\n\nI.E. if your repository has the GPL licence then any contribution you accept is automatically licenced from the author under GPL. You would then have the same rights as everyone else in terms of being able to use the project under the GPL licence. Which would include being able to upload it to Steam.\n\nI'll note that some licences explicitly have a \"by making a contribution you agree to release it under this licence\" - but not all (e.g. the MIT licence does not). In that case you /could/ have someone claim that they did not licence it under MIT, but you'd then be able to point to the GitHub PR and terms and conditions to point out that they implicitly did.\n\nOthers solve this by having a PR template that has a checkbox with \"I agree to licence this code under /the/ licence”.\n\nThese protect you in ensuring that the code is licenced in a way which allows you to use it *without assigning copyright*.\n\nFinally I'll note that when you say you want a CLA it's similar to saying you want an open source licence. These are a category rather than a specific document, and there are many choices with many pros and cons depending on your objectives. This is why people keep asking you what your objectives of a CLA is. On the flip side, because *most* CLAs involve assigning copyright people will make assumptions that this is your objective.\n\nI say this because the quote I started my comment with seems to suggest that you **might** not actually care about transferring ownership from contributors to yourself, but actually just want to ensure that contributions are licenced under the projects licence (which would enable you to use it).",

Happy to answer any questions about the project / vision.\n\n**A Note on Setup & Docs**\n\nTools used in video tutorial: git, WSL, Docker Desktop, Gmail API, Visual Studio Code\n\nThe video tutorial is probably the best guide, especially for the Gmail API setup which can be tricky: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXlCdcsXPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXlCdcsXPE) (thx to contributor Chrysostomos! 🙏)  \n  \nBut if you prefer written instructions, here you go: [https://github.com/just-a-job-app/jobseeker-analytics/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/just-a-job-app/jobseeker-analytics/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) \n\n**Project Origin & Future Vision**\n\nI started this project during my own job search to track applications without ripping my hair out. Right now, it’s a semi-solid, automated application tracker.\n\nThe goal is to evolve this into a tool that helps you manage the most important part of a job search: the people and conversations that lead to offers.\n\nSome of the features I'm planning include:\n\n* Resume to job posting recommendation engine (super excited about this one)\n* Auto-archiving rejections to keep you motivated and focused on the opportunities yet to come\n* Helping you track and update friends and family to see if they know anyone at your target companies\n* Surfacing timely and relevant local job opportunities (shoutout to the job board hiring.cafe)\n\nThe full source code is on GitHub and I'd love any feedback on the project or the vision!\n\n* **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/just-a-job-app/jobseeker-analytics](https://github.com/just-a-job-app/jobseeker-analytics)",

Probably not, but you *can*.\n\n> after updating you'll see obtanium telling you there's basically a version mismatch and obtanium has the older version now...\n\nThe version is different because Obtainium just released an update. This update hasn't yet shown up on F-Droid, because F-Droid has to [build the app](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/wiki/-/wikis/FAQ#general).\n\nYou \"updated\" Obtainium to a lower version (and different package flavor) with F-Droid, which doesn't match the version Obtainium tracks itself with via GitHub.\n\nIf you want to use Obtainium *and* F-Droid, either:\n\n - Install Obtainium [from GitHub](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases), then install F-Droid [from **GitLab**](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient/-/releases) or their [website](https://f-droid.org) (they don't publish [on GitHub](https://github.com/f-droid/fdroidclient/releases) anymore). Don't update Obtainium from inside F-Droid.\n\n  - Alternatively, add F-Droid as an app with their GitLab or website URL inside Obtainium, and never update F-Droid with itself, and Obtainium with F-Droid.\n\n     (only update Obtainium with itself, and only update F-Droid with Obtainium.)\n\n - Install F-Droid from GitLab or their website, then install Obtainium [from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.imranr.obtainium.fdroid).\n\n Obtainium installed from F-Droid does not list itself inside Obtainium, which prevents it from updating itself to a different version (or flavor) not built by F-Droid. (this doesn't apply if you first installed Obtainium independently.)\n\n... Or you could do what it was designed for and forget the F-Droid app, and install everything with Obtainium. If an app is only published on F-Droid, then add the app's F-Droid URL to Obtainium.\n\n\n> ...that app is \"Joplin.\" I manually entered the github URL and it states their isn't a valid release to install.\n\nYou're probably not entering their Android app repository: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin-android. The source code and releases for all platforms are [here](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin), but the repository above is the only one that has releases for the Android builds.",

Thus, there's really no way to *avoid* bigger companies from using anything you open-source. Your best bet would be to use a license generally disliked by bigger companies that doesn't hinder smaller companies from doing their work.\n\nOne thing you can do is go with a [weak copyleft license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft#Strong_and_weak_copyleft) such as the LGPL or the MPL. These licenses allow derivative works to be licensed whichever way they'd like, while requiring that any changes made to the \"original work\" be published under a share-alike clause. What exactly qualifies as the \"original work\" will depend from license to license, but I know offhand that the MPL uses a by-file basis. That is, any change made to MPL-licensed source code files must, themselves, be shared as MPL licensed code. From what I know, the *GPL family of licenses raises alarm bells for larger companies, so perhaps going with LGPL could get you where you want on reputation alone, but you'd need to communicate to smaller entities in some clear way that they're still free to *make use* of your code however they'd like, while contributing back to the original work where it's modified.",

        "body": "> I don’t want that big companies can use it as well. \n\nThen you don't want to open source it. Which is fine! Not everything must be open source.\n\nBut by [the OSI definition of open source](https://opensource.org/osd) and any other reasonable alternative, once you start distinguishing who may use the software and who may not, then it's no longer open source. Being able to use software the way you choose, for whatever purpose you like, is core to the very idea of \"open source\".\n\nIf your project shares some of the goals of open-source software, but you want additional restrictions, you're probably looking at a Source Available project and license rather than an Open Source project and license.\n\nThat said, **within the constraints of open source**, you do have some options for preventing some kinds of behaviors and requiring others. Often, these restrictions make software *unwanted* by big corporations trying to monopolize something, even though it doesn't prevent them from actually using or modifying it. It's possible that might be enough for you.\n\nFor example, the AGPL (GNU/Affero GPL) is an open-source, copyleft license variant of the GPL. This means it requires that software based on it must be released under the same terms, and that includes that source must be provided to anyone you provide it to. The AGPL makes it explicit that \"using the software to provide a service\" (like SaaS) counts as distribution. This makes AGPL software unappetizing to most people who would want to profit from it, and particularly to larger organizations.",

That lack of CLA shows a more significant commitment to open source (alhough not assured) so I'd generally favour a non-CLA project over a CLA project.\n\nWith CLAs I see many gloss-over or mislead regarding the rights and purpose of CLAs, and I'd have more respect for a company which is just up-front. As an example, just a few days ago I came across this under a \"Simple terms\" section in someone's CLA:\n\n> Your code gets published under the open source AGPL license and will always be available to the community.\n\nWhich is just flat out misleading since the purpose was dual-licensing, including with combination with non-AGPL works.\n\nOne thing to consider: It can natrually make you a little more prone to community forks gaining momentum over your original works, since they'd be able to share changes freely between eachother wheras you'd have to specifically gain permission to do so.",

It's not specific to the AGPL, but rather to ownership of the code.  Even the Free Software Foundation does that, because they want to be able to compel license violators to comply.\n\n> Which I know is controversial. \n\nIt's controversial because some majority-authors have used CLAs to change the license from FS/OS to something else - a \"rug pull\".  That's because when you sign a typical CLA, you surrender your ownership of your code.  You have to either trust the person/organization you're handing the code over to, or just not care.",

For example, Freescout is an AGPL support tool. Businesses can use it worry free. If they change it, they need to share their changes. It’s only a deterrent if they want to build your product into theirs. \n\nOf course, if you are creating a component then yes, AGPL will kill adoption.

But if you're going to depend on community contributions to any significant extent, CLAs are a bad idea\n\n\nThe other is that this allows you to essentially pull the rug on them by suddenly changing the license. A dont do that, but also add some protections in the CLA that stops you from doing that",

From UI to research etc. If you can start on some of that and document it really well while advertising “please steal this idea” then it’s possible someone might (though not guaranteed). Do it somewhere public, ideally something like a blog. “Sell” both the problem and your ideas for fixes and solicit feedback. Try to find interested or related communities.\n\n- Use this as an opportunity to learn to code your first app. Use the community to help you decide where to get started and how to cut scope to make things easier. Bonus: step one is identical as you will need your notes to share what you want to accomplish. \n\n- alternatively, find software that seems like it should have that feature and try to connect with the authors. Or if you can’t, having a discrete example allows you to ask questions like “what language was it written in” and “how did they implement feature Y”\n\n- if you want to hire someone, be warned that the costs will likely be higher that you guess. And not all software succeeds. If you are not good at communicating your requirements and vision, you might spend a lot on something that isn’t what you want. ",

I think most devs feel exploited and that's why they react like that, try not to take it to heart, it happens on any suggestion about any topic on any project. From most people you will only get \"if you want it, build it yourself\".\n\nNow, I might have a solution for you, but it will require quite a lot of work. So it really depends on how much you really want this, and how much you believe in it.\n\nI am building a crowdfunding platform for exactly people like you, who need open source tools, but can't/won't fund it on their own. It's for people willing to pay, but who are realistic about pricing and know they can't pay a devs salary for months just to get some tool that should be supposedly \"free open source for everybody\".\n\nThe challenges? Well, for once it is new, and second: you will have to find other people like you, who also want this. Basically how it works is: you start a project, inside the project you add ideas (like feature requests), and anyone can join to help enhance it with more features by adding more ideas, or contribute with design or whatever.\n\nThen anyone can \"donate\" to it, which is kept in the specific idea you donated to, and developers only get the money once they deliver what you asked for.  Ans if you ever change your mind or give up, you can withdraw the money again.\n\nI never liked the idea of donating to projects without a clear reward or clear goal, and this is my way of building a place where people can get the tools they are actually paying/requesting.\n\nThe cool part is that you share the costs for projects like these with hundreds or thousands of other people, who each contribute with what they can/want. But i do expect it to require to reach a much higher amount than hiring a developer directly. Reasons: well first, because devs get paid once ideas are delivered. While they can deliver one idea/features at a time and get paid for it (doesn't require the full project at once), it still does require up front work, so expect devs to want a much higher prize to take on that risk. It is also completely new and unknown, so expect it to be even higher.\n\nBut still, I like the idea of paying $100-1000 on my own to have my problem solved, instead of paying thousands to a dev without knowing if I'll even ever get the product I'm paying for, or if he'll give up in the middle and never deliver, or deliver something that doesn't work.\n\nDoes that interest you? If yes, then I'm looking for projects just like yours. But to warn you again: this WILL take time from you. You won't get others easy, you will have to describe it, promote it to other people like you, or find someone that will do all that.\n\nThere is a system of participation though. So if you do all that work, and prepare that whole project for a dev to take on then, at the time of payment, you get a % of the project as a reward for your efforts. Much smaller piece than the dev, of course, but still, I think it's a cool way to reward real work.\n\nI hope you don't mind me advertising my project here like this, it just felt like your case is exactly what I'm looking for, so hopefully we can both help each other out.",

Can you recommend others sites where I could submit my app? I don’t trust AI-generated “top 40 websites…”, would like to hear from real people.",

    "selftext": "As some of you may know, a **new bittorrent tracker/site platform** built with Rust/VueJS is in the works. Here is the [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1jpm9ja/introducing_arcadia/) and a [progress report](https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/1kpgavu/arcadia_progress_report/).\n\nWhen this started, my motivation was high and things went fast. I'm still very motivated to bring arcadia to a production-ready level, but I need at least 1 other \"core\" dev to work with me. Since this is a community project, I'm not expecting instant replies, daily commits, etc. But a buddy to share the pain and the fun with :) **we are humans after all, social beings!** Some people already made very nice contributions (and I thank you all again!), but it's not the same as having someone who knows the codebase well, can take informed decisions, etc.\n\nSo if you are (or know someone who might be) interested in building what could be the next big thing in the torrenting realm, please dm me here or on discord (@FrenchGithubUser) and let's chat! I will happily give more details and assistance for whatever is needed! Also **feel free to post on your private tracker forums/irc** to let other know about arcadia! I believe that coding with others is paramount for projects of this size!\n\nQuick links:\n\n* [screenshots](https://github.com/Arcadia-Solutions/arcadia/?tab=readme-ov-file#arcadia)\n* discord link in the readme:\n* [github repositories](https://github.com/orgs/Arcadia-Solutions/repositories)\n\nAs a reminder, **arcadia is a programming project**, aiming at bringing a tool to the community. We are **not going to host you typical private tracker** (although some might). However, I recently rolled out a demo site for the ones interested in testing/developing arcadia. If you are interested, join the discord server.",

    "title": "Open-Source Dataset Generation for Training LLMs | Create AI Subject Matter Experts | Augmentoolkit 3.0",
    "selftext": "Sometimes there’s a problem you feel called to solve — or one that you get deep enough into that, being stubborn, you keep working on it until either you break or the problem does.\n\nTeaching LLMs new facts has been that problem for me. I started working on it when I was doing client work last year, and I went *All In* on it at the start of this year. After 7 months of nonstop work, research, iteration, training, dataset generation, blood, sweat, and tears, it’s finally complete: Augmentoolkit 3.0 is out. [It’s on GitHub right now.](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit)\n\nBut what even is [Augmentoolkit](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit)? Even if you’ve used the project before, everything about it has changed, so this summary of what it is *now* is worth a read:\n\n[**Augmentoolkit**](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit) **is a production-ready way to train AI subject matter experts.** It lets you update an LLM's knowledge cutoff and put new facts into its brain, without any retrival needed. You can then do reinforcement learning to improve its performance in any task you can imagine. And you can do all this locally with open-source models!\n\nIt includes:\n\n\\- **Factual finetuning:** A massive data pipeline which, given some documents, will automatically generate training data that teaches an LLM the facts inside. Augmentoolkit will then automatically train an AI on those documents for you, download it, and prepare it for inference on your computer.\n\n\\- **Data generation model:** A custom dataset generation LLM built for running Augmentoolkit pipelines, allowing at-scale dataset generation on your own hardware.\n\n\\- **Individual Alignment:** an experimental GRPO training pipeline where you have the option of making an LLM be your reward model. Write a prompt to grade an LLM's output against any criteria you can think of -- by grading better responses higher, your LLM will be trained to respond more like that in the future. You can also do traditional reward-function-based RL. Finally, alignment can be done on an individual level, rather than a one-size-doesn't-fit-all approach.\n\n\\- **Automatic RAG dataset generation:** in case you still want grounding, Augmentoolkit will repurpose its generated questions and answers at the end of a data generation run into a dataset ready for powering a RAG system. It can also automatically run a RAG-powered inferene API for you to use.\n\n\\- **Production scale:** even if you generate gigabytes of data with it, Augmentoolkit's code won't break or become painfully slow. The dataset generation model, whose dataset was about 2 gigabytes large at the end, had its dataset made using an Augmentoolkit pipeline.\n\n\\- **Easy use:** making data is easy, intuitive, and fast. Augmentoolkit's start scripts mean all you need to do to get started is to run a single command. A custom-built interface allows full functionality without touching a command line or code editor.\n\n\\- **Tools to build your own data:** a whole bunch of reusable code, templates, conventions, examples, and abstractions are at your disposal for when you want to make your own dataset generation pipelines. When you want to make a custom LLM that does something that no other model does, Augmentoolkit is the place to start.\n\n\\- **Classifier training:** Augmentoolkit has a pipeline which takes raw text and some labels you specify; and uses an LLM to bootstrap a binary classification dataset. It will keep training BERT models and expanding the dataset until the model reaches a certain % accuracy. Comparable to human-labelled data but with no intensive work.\n\n\\- **Creators community:** Share what you're creating or get help creating it on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/s6PBfsaVzu)\n\n# Why this is useful\n\nTraining an LLM on facts, rather than relying on including these facts in-context, comes with many benefits. Besides faster generation times and lower costs, an expert AI that is trained on a domain gains a \"big-picture\" understanding of the subject that a generalist just won't have. It's the difference between giving a new student a class's full textbook and asking them to write an exam, versus asking a graduate student in that subject to write the exam. The new student probably won't even know where in that book to look for the information it needs, and even if it sees the correct context, there's no guarantee that it understands what it means or how it fits into the bigger picture.\n\n[Augmentoolkit](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit) proves that, through a specific combination of data and hyperparameters aimed at intensely learning facts without compromising generalist performance, an LLM can learn even the facts of an entirely new domain through training. While the method excels at improving a model's understanding, giving it a big-picture view of a subject, and consistently answering questions about the core concepts and relationships within a domain, the approach naturally prioritizes information that appears frequently across the training materials. Details mentioned only once or twice in a large corpus may require additional reinforcement — and Augmentoolkit gives you the tools to do this, for instance by increasing the number of times data is generated from specific documents, or by grounding edge-cases with RAG. Indeed, Augmentoolkit does not necessarily compete with RAG, but can instead improve on it: LLMs trained with Augmentoolkit are trained to, if there is retrieved context, use that first -- and then, if retrieval fails, they fall back to their memorized information to try and answer questions, providing a \"second line of defence\" with their parametric memory.\n\nFinally, a practical note on hallucination: Augmentoolkit draws on research that training a model to say \"I don't know\" when a question is not something it was trained on can dramatically reduce false positive rates. This is used to great effect here -- Augmentoolkit models correct questions with factually faulty premises and acknowledge a lack of knowledge when asked things they don't remember too well. By doing SFT on types of data like this, the models learn to clearly define the boundaries of what they do and do not understand.\n\nYou can be confident in getting high-quality specialist models when you use Augmentoolkit.\n\n# Why this is meaningful\n\nTrying to build AI apps based on closed-source LLMs released by big labs, sucks:\n\n\\- The lack of stable checkpoints under the control of the person running the model, makes the tech unstable and unpredictable to build on.\n\n\\- Capabilities change without warning and models are frequently made worse.\n\n\\- People building with AI have to work around the LLMs they are using (a moving target), rather than make the LLMs they are using fit into their system\n\n\\- Censorship and refusals force people deploying models to dance around the stuck-up morality of these models while developing.\n\n\\- Closed-source labs charge obscene prices, doing monopolistic rent collecting and impacting the margins of their customers.\n\n\\- Using closed-source labs is a privacy nightmare, especially now that API providers may be required by law to save and log formerly-private API requests.\n\n\\- Different companies have to all work with the same set of models, which have the same knowledge, the same capabilities, the same opinions, and they all sound more or less the same.\n\nBut current open-source models either suffer from a severe lack of capability, or are massive enough that they might as well be closed-source for most of the people trying to run them. The solution? Small, efficient, powerful models that achieve superior performance on the things they are being used for (and sacrifice performance in the areas they **aren't** being used for) which are trained and controlled by the companies that use them.\n\nWith Augmentoolkit:\n\n\\- Companies train their models, decide when those models update, and have full transparency over what went into them.\n\n\\- Capabilities change only when the company wants, and no one is forcing them to make their models worse.\n\n\\- People working with AI can customize the model they are using to function as part of the system they are designing, rather than having to twist their system to match a model.\n\n\\- Since you control the data it is built on, the model is only as censored as you want it to be.\n\n\\- 7 billion parameter models (the standard size Augmentoolkit trains) are so cheap to run it is absurd. They can run on a laptop, even.\n\n\\- Because you control your model, you control your inference, and you control your customers' data.\n\n\\- With your model's capabilities being fully customizable, your AI sounds like **your** AI, and has the opinions and capabilities that you want it to have.\n\nNow, using Augmentoolkit's factual finetuning ability, you can control what facts your AI knows, and — since opinions are just subjective facts — you decide what it believes. With the experimental GRPO pipeline and the ability to easily create your own data pipelines, if you want to go further, then you can control every aspect of your model's capaibilities. Open-source LLMs had the promise of customization, but people and organizations needed to invest absurd time and money to even get started, with no guarantee of success.\n\n# No longer.\n\nAugmentoolkit's production-ready factual finetuning is the best open-source dataset generation pipeline. It has evolved from the experience of multiple successful consulting projects. [Demo models](https://huggingface.co/Heralax/llama-Augmentoolkit-Openstax-Nursing-Books/blob/main/README.md) [are available](https://huggingface.co/Heralax/llama-Augmentoolkit-Quickstart-Factual-Demo-Example) now for you to see some example results. [Try it yourself!](https://github.com/e-p-armstrong/augmentoolkit#macos-interface)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/opensource,\n\nOver the past few months we’ve been tinkering late nights to put together something we really care about: **Flossx83**, what we believe is the world’s first fully open‑source ISO 8583 financial auditing and simulation suite. We started this as a way to really understand how payment messages flow - from POS to switch to issuer - and quickly realized there wasn’t a free, community‑driven tool that brought it all together.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Simulate** card payment messages (ATM, POS, etc.)\n* Run them through a **Java card switch** you can self‑host\n* Score transactions with a built‑in **fraud detection engine**\n* **Audit every step immutably** so you can trace exactly what happened\n\nWe’ve poured our own curiosity and countless cups of coffee into this repo, and it’s now ready for anyone to clone, run locally, and start experimenting - no vendor lock‑in, no pricey hardware required.\n\n🔗 **Give it a spin:**\n\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/gracemann365/Flossx83](https://github.com/gracemann365/Flossx83) (Star - if you liked it)\n* Live demo: [https://gracemann365.github.io/Flossx83/](https://gracemann365.github.io/Flossx83/)\n\nWe’d be so grateful for any feedback on the code, documentation, or ideas for new features. If you’ve got thoughts on performance tweaks, additional audit hooks, or just want to share war stories from your own payment‑tech adventures, please chime in.\n\nBuilding this in the open has been both nerve‑wracking and incredibly rewarding - We're looking forward to growing it with your help. Thanks for checking it out, and hope you find it useful!\n\nCredits to my co-builder - u/Gracemann_365\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gracemann_365/)",

    "selftext": "Hi r/opensource,\n\nI'm a beginner in programming and open source, and recently I started working on a small project that means a lot to me. It's far from perfect, but I decided to put it out in the open, hoping it might grow with the help of others.\n\nGitHub Repo: [footprint cleaner LOL](https://github.com/Codex-Crusader/digital-footprint-cleaner) \n\n# What the Project Is About\n\nIt’s a web app that helps users **find traces of their online presence** and **draft basic, legal petitions** to request removal. It’s aimed at people who care about privacy but may not have the tools or knowledge to clean up their digital footprint.\n\nWhat it has so far:\n\n* A simple interface (white and purple theme)\n* A page to search for digital footprints\n* A page to generate removal petitions\n\nIt’s still early, and I know there’s a lot of room for improvement.\n\n# Why I’m Posting This?\n\nI’m still learning—Python, HTML/CSS, and everything that goes into making a real, functioning app. This is my first step into open source, and while it’s a bit scary, it’s also something I’m proud of.\n\nI’m sharing it here in the hope that someone out there might be interested in contributing—not because the project is big or important, but because maybe we could build something meaningful together. Even small suggestions, bug fixes, or feedback would mean a lot.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys helping beginners or just likes working on privacy-related tools, I’d be incredibly grateful to have you take a look.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\\- Codex Crusader ([linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bhargavaram-krishnapur-5309a7245))",

    "selftext": "Hey folks, my name is Juan, I've been working in the software industry since 2021. I started out as a developer maintaining a legacy .NET app with infrastructure in AWS. That’s where I first got interested in cloud architecture, which eventually led me down the AWS certification path and into more formal infrastructure and DevOps roles.\n\nI always wanted to learn or work with Go, but I never really had the chance to jump into any project that used it. In 2023, after a couple of years prepping for AWS certifications, between all the cert studying and job hopping, I burned out a couple of times.\n\nAt some point, I just realized I didn’t want my career to be like that. With all the noise around AI and the constant talk of jobs being replaced, I found myself wanting to step away from the rat race. I decided to start focusing more on working with projects I actually care about.\n\nI’m deeply interested in cryptocurrencies because of their potential to decentralize and democratize transactions. I am venezuelan, and in 2017/2018 I was able to send money to my family through [localbitcoins.net](https://localbitcoins.net/) in a very difficult time when all international transactions were blocked, Cryptocurrencies were (and still are) a lifeline for many people. Btw, I truly recommend [https://whycryptocurrencies.com/](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/), really good lecture, it really inspired me to start working on this project.\n\nUntil I started this project, I felt wary of cold wallets, mostly because I didn’t really understand how they worked internally. I never felt comfortable with anything other than MetaMask (though I’m not a huge fan of storing keys in browser storage either). Another app I used a lot is LemonCash, which functions more like an exchange, letting you use crypto and automatically convert it to pesos while supporting different tokens, so I decided to build a desktop cold wallet in Go, something that sits between both applications.\n\nInvestigating about frameworks I ran into wails, and I decided to start building the HD wallet, not to create a product but to learn in the process and get familar with the industry. I've been building it since January, in the beginning I thought of supporting a few tokens (like USDC, ETH, BTC, SOL). At the moment I have only managed to build the ETH infrastructure, but this has turned into the side project I’ve stuck with the longest.\n\nUntil now, I’ve been building it quietly and sharing progress within my personal network. But with the amount of time and thought I’ve put into it, I felt it was time to open it up to the community, get feedback, and maybe even find people interested in contributing.\n\nHere’s the repo: [https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet](https://github.com/deaconPush/ubiDist/tree/main/wails/wallet), and here is a video with a basic [demo](https://files.catbox.moe/x8pzhr.mp4).\n\nIt’s still rough around the edges, and as it is my first Go project the structure is still pretty raw. I’ve been focusing on keeping the architecture flexible and avoiding overengineering. So far, I’ve implemented a basic UI to create and restore wallets, store data in a SQLite DB, and send ETH transactions to other accounts using the local Hardhat network. Next steps include improving security, adding integration tests, helpful logging, and starting to add support for new tokens.\n\nI’ve always been a big fan of open source but never had the self-confidence to contribute, maybe this is my way into that world.\n\nThanks for reading, happy to connect with like minded engineers!",

Here’s the current shape of the problem and where I see AI (like johnE.ai) actually helping in kitchens:\n\nDomain:\nThe “hand-off problem” hits kitchens hard—turnover is brutal, burnout is high, and processes live in people’s heads, not systems. Managers and cooks are both overwhelmed by constant schedule changes, last-minute callouts, and a lack of clear, shareable knowledge about what’s happening in real time.\n\nWhere AI Helps:\nI’m building the system so that AI automates the grunt work (like onboarding checklists, reminders, and shift swaps), while leaving judgment calls—what’s “86’d,” who covers, how to flex for a busy night—squarely in human hands. It’s more about making sure nobody gets left in the dark rather than running the kitchen by algorithm.\n\nOn Failure and Fallbacks:\nTotally agree: no one wants to be left holding the bag when the system goes down. That’s why I’m building in offline-friendly workflows and human override at every step. If the AI can’t parse a weird request, the team gets an alert—never a silent fail. The fallback is always: the humans can step in, see the history, and take over. Worst case, it’s back to pen and paper for a minute, but no data gets lost or hidden.\n\nIf you’ve seen good or bad examples of this kind of hand-off (in any field), I’d love to hear it. The goal is empowerment, not extraction—and I want to get the hard parts right from the start.",

    "selftext": "Hey [r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/)! I've been working on **SSHplex**, a Python-based SSH multiplexer that makes managing multiple server connections actually enjoyable.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Modern Terminal UI\n* Multiple Sources of Truth Provider (Netbox, Ansible, Statics)\n* Creates organized tmux sessions with all your SSH connections\n* Intelligent caching\n\n**Why I built it:** Tired of juggling multiple terminal windows and remembering server IPs. Wanted something that integrates with existing infrastructure tools but keeps the workflow simple. Used to have Remote Desktop Manager, but it was too bulky.\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* Python 3.8+ with Textual for the TUI\n* tmux integration for reliable multiplexing\n* YAML configuration with XDG compliance\n* MIT licensed\n\n**Current status:** Early development, but fully functional. Looking for feedback and contributors!\n\n**Future features :**\n\n* Docker discovery\n* Terminator Mux\n* Hyper Mux\n\n**Try it:**\n\n    pip install sshplex\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from the community! Always looking for ways to improve the UX and add new integrations.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/sabrimjd/sshplex](https://github.com/sabrimjd/sshplex)",

Multiple people can all be doing this simultaneously, but if there is a conflict when you try to merge (i.e. someone updated the same piece of code you are trying to change before you), you will have to resolve the conflicts to merge.\n\nThe whole process is usually managed through something like GitHub's Pull Request system, where you create a Pull Request from your branch so it can be reviewed and merged.\n\nDo some research on distributed development or common Git workflows to better understand.",

It's giving Atom-inspired.\n\nOf these, the most vetted options are VSCodium (if only by proxy), Neovim, and Emacs. Zed seems to have a growing following and a *very* dedicated dev team (they're very active on [their blog](https://zed.dev/blog)), and, as for the rest, they at least have passion behind them. I figure the others are good if you wanna experiment, but I'd go with VSCodium, Neovim, Emacs, or Zed for something long-term. Hope this is valuable!\n\n*Yes, there are [Neovim GUIs](https://github.com/topics/neovim-guis), but if you're gonna use a Neovim GUI you're probably better off with one of the other options, maybe with vim-motions turned on.",

We are seeing **5X faster MLP layer performance** in transformers with 50% lesser memory consumption avoiding the sleeping nodes in every token prediction. For Llama 3.2, Feed forward layers accounted for **30% of total weights** and forward pass computation resulting in **1.6-1.8x increase** in throughput:\n\n    Sparse LLaMA 3.2 3B vs LLaMA 3.2 3B (on HuggingFace Implementation):\n    - Time to First Token (TTFT):  1.51× faster (1.209s → 0.803s)\n    - Output Generation Speed:     1.79× faster (0.7 → 1.2 tokens/sec)  \n    - Total Throughput:           1.78× faster (0.7 → 1.3 tokens/sec)\n    - Memory Usage:               26.4% reduction (6.125GB → 4.15GB)\n\nPlease find the operator kernels with differential weight caching open sourced.\n\nPS: We will be actively adding kernels for int8, CUDA and sparse attention.",

You can find it here: https://github.com/byrdsandbytes/snapcast-pi/\n\nAs it got some stars on github and people seem to like it, I will continue.\n\nLast week i started building the angular web application. (see picture X)\n\nThis week I was not very structured but here’s what i did:\n\nA. Started UX-wanking the screens. Choose colors. Choose „IBM Plex Mono“ as the font as i want to give it a retro vibe. B. Started to search for a local first database. Currently testing rxDB as the architecture is based on observables. (Rxjs) C. Also started to structure the project (roadmap, versioning on github etc.). D. Had to give the project a name to keep myself motivated. Named it „Beatnik“. E. Created a subreddit r/beatnikAudio/ F. Started website.\n\nThe progress is not that visual this week. But here’s some updated screenshots as well as some first pictures of the website (where docs will go).\n\nI’m happy where this is going. What do you guys think? Good direction? Wired if you give an open source project a brand?\n\nWhat about rxDB? Any hate for RxDB here?\n\nWhat do you think of the “no mics. No alexa …” part? For me, that’s one of the main reasons I’m building this. I don’t want them in my flat.",

    "selftext": "I wanted a fast, lightweight Spotlight alternative that I could use on Windows and on Linux Mint since I use both systems. So i coded Seeksy, which is an invokable desktop search utility for quickly finding files, apps and emoji (since Wayland gave me trouble with those). \n\nRuns seamlessly in the background, ready to open with **Ctrl + Space** (default shortcut). Fully customizable via the settings menu, accessible through the gear icon or the tray icon's context menu.\n\nPerhaps others might find this tool useful as well. \n\n# Highlights\n\n* 🔎 **Universal Search** \\- Search files, folders, applications and emoji from a single, invokable search interface. You set the folders you want indexed, and it only considers those. You are in full control. \n* 🖥️ **Multi-Platform Support** \\- Works on Windows and Linux - and technically Macs even.\n* ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation** \\- Navigate search results with arrow keys for all keyboard warriors\n* 🎮 **App Launcher** \\- Auto-detects all applications and installed games (initial indexing may take a few minutes though)\n* 🚀 **Intelligent Indexing** \\- Fast background content indexing with adaptive performance optimization\n* ⭐ **Favorites System** \\- Mark frequently used items as favorites for quick access\n* 🎨 **Customizable Settings** \\- Choose between dark/light mode, accent colors, and configurable search shortcut (default: Ctrl + Space)\n\n  \n**TL;DR**\n\nSeeksy is a fast, cross-platform, and fully configurable desktop search tool—ideal for quickly launching files, apps, and picking emoji. Offers favorites and a lot of customization regarding colors, themes, etc.\n\n**Website and Download**: [https://andreasjhagen.github.io/Seeksy/](https://andreasjhagen.github.io/Seeksy/)  \n**Repo**: [https://github.com/andreasjhagen/Seeksy/](https://github.com/andreasjhagen/Seeksy/)",

Everything else is rewritten in Rust, designed for speed and reliability.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/AmarBego/Rscoop](https://github.com/AmarBego/Rscoop)  \nThe installer and portable builds are available on the latest release page. It’s still in early development, so there may be a few rough edges. Feedback, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome.\n\nFor developers:  \nRscoop is open-source and built with Rust and SolidJS using the Tauri framework. Contributions are welcome, and the repo includes full instructions for setting up a development environment.\n\nI built this because I wanted something like it for myself. If others find it useful too, that’s even better.\n\nThanks for taking a look.",

CoreUI is developed and maintained by a small team of professionals on a full-time basis.

        "body": "If you go open source with this, then that means people will no longer pay for being allowed to use it, and this implies that just building and distributing the thing is no longer something you can monetize. Period.\n\nThus, if you want to open-source this and stay afloat, you need to find some other serious source of revenue.\n\nFor the vast majority of highly profitable open source projects, that source of revenue lies in some other line of business, something that benefits from the sheer existence of the open source code. For example, modern web browsers like Chrome and Firefox are largely funded by online advertising companies (most notably Google / Alphabet), because the existence of a free high-quality web browser means people will do more things online, spend more time looking at web pages, spend more time looking at online ads, and thus create more ad revenue. This works so well that nobody is even trying to make money selling proprietary web browsers anymore.\n\nAnother common example of such \"complementary products\", one that's closer to your situation, is when you're in the business of building websites, or doing web consultancy, and develop something like a web framework to support your operation. This benefits you in two ways: first, you now have a web framework that does exactly what you need for your cash cow operation (building websites), and building a community around it helps it gain exposure and credibility; and second, once that framework takes off and becomes popular, being the people who invented it is powerful PR for your company and will help you score more clients. You're not making any money off of the framework itself, but the investment pays off through the high-quality business it attracts for you and through the way it enhances the quality and efficiency of the work you can deliver.\n\nDual licensing rarely works; the \"copyleft\" license is going to restrict adoption for many users beyond the ones you're targeting, and you will need contributors to sign over their rights to you so that you can relicense them for your own benefit - this is going to scare away a lot of potential contributors, so unless you do the lion's share of the work, the most likely outcome is that someone goes and forks your version, pulling in your changes as you publish them, and adding all sorts of community contributions that you cannot use because you can't relicense them, but the fork, which just publishes everything under the original copyleft license, and doesn't need to bother with any alternative licenses, can. So now you're basically still developing a proprietary product, but you're also giving away parts of the codebase to a competing open source project, while being unable to pull their contributions back into your own codebase. Worst of both worlds, really.\n\n\"Enterprise support\" can work, but only if your product is important enough and has a strong enough reputation to be considered \"solid\" or \"serious\". Few open source projects manage to pull this off; the only ones I can think off, off the top of my head, would be RedHat and (arguably) Canonical. Both sell operating systems, and I don't think that's a coincidence - operating systems are crucial parts of an information system, essential to the functioning of most organizations, and they are large, complex beasts that require a lot of expertise to make, maintain, and support. I don't think you'd be able to manuever a UI component library into such a position - it's just neither complex nor important enough.\n\nAnother source of revenue that *can* work is \"someone else's money\". While commercially successful open source projects generally have to support some other (profitable) cause, that cause doesn't have to be your own; it is quite common to have someone pay you for developing open source code, and they are willing to pay not for the (exclusive-ish) right to use it, but for its sheer existence. That \"someone\" could be a company (e.g., a software company whose operation is committed to a given programming language might have an interest in paying someone to add features they need to the language's toolchain, or to fix bugs that affect them - they don't need exclusive access to those improvements, they just need them to exist, and they will happily pay for that even if it benefits their competition as well), but it can also be some kind of government agency, NPO, university, etc. Such organizations often offer grants or other sources of money for software development, and since the goal is to make that software widely accessible, making it open source is often fine, or even a requirement. After all, the purpose of public money is to improve something for a lot of people, and proprietary licensing can conflict with that.\n\nAs for real world examples: most of the code I write professionally is open source. I work for a software consultancy firm, and our clients pay us to improve programming toolchains, contribute to open source codebases that help their primary operations, or build things that benefit society at large. However, some clients also pay us to write proprietary code, though these are typically in-house projects or proprietary software that ships as part of a larger product or service, not software sold as the main product under a restrictive proprietary licensing scheme.",

    "title": "Flowfile: Visual ETL tool that converts between drag-and-drop workflows and Python code",
    "selftext": "Hi, r/opensource \n\nI'd like to share a project I've been building called Flowfile. My goal was to create a tool that bridges the gap between visual, low-code ETL platforms (like Alteryx or KNIME) and pure-code data pipelines, combining the best of both worlds in a fully open-source package.\n\n* GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/Edwardvaneechoud/Flowfile/](https://github.com/Edwardvaneechoud/Flowfile/)\n* Demo GIF: [https://github.com/Edwardvaneechoud/Flowfile/blob/main/.github/images/code-generator-gif.gif](https://github.com/Edwardvaneechoud/Flowfile/blob/main/.github/images/code-generator-gif.gif)\n* Quick Install: pip install Flowfile\n\n**Projects' Philosophy**\n\nMany visual ETL tools are powerful but operate as black boxes. They can lock you into proprietary formats and, instead of bridging the gap between engineers and data owners, they often widen it. I wanted to build an alternative centered on transparency, flexibility, and community. With Flowfile, you can create data flows from both code and a visual UI, and even convert the visual graphs back into clean, standalone Python code. This keeps everyone on the same page and ensures you're always in control, with no vendor lock-in.\n\n**What My Project Does**\n\nFlowfile provides a bidirectional workflow for creating data pipelines:\n\n* Visual-to-Code: Use a drag-and-drop editor to build a pipeline visually, and Flowfile will generate a clean, standalone Python script using lazy Polars for high performance.\n* Code-to-Visual: Write Polars-like Python code, and Flowfile can automatically generate an interactive, visual graph of your pipeline. This is great for debugging, documenting, and sharing your work with less technical colleagues.\n\nThis \"round-trip\" capability means you can seamlessly switch between visual building and coding, using the best approach for the task at hand.\n\n**The Tech Stack**\n\nThe entire project is built with open-source technologies, and the architecture is designed to be modular:\n\n* Backend: The core ETL engine and a separate compute worker are built with FastAPI and leverage Polars for all data transformations.\n* Frontend: The UI is a modern web app built with Vue.js and can be run in the browser or as a standalone desktop application via Electron.\n* Database: Uses SQLAlchemy for managing user data, secrets, and database connections.\n* Deployment: The full stack is orchestrated with Docker Compose, making it easy to self-host.\n* CI/CD: We use GitHub Actions for testing, documentation deployment, and PyPI releases, ensuring a stable development process.\n\n**Comparison to Alternatives**\n\n* vs. Pure Code (Pandas/Polars): Flowfile adds a visual layer on top of your code automatically, making complex pipelines easier to debug, explain, and document.\n* vs. Visual ETL Tools (Alteryx, KNIME): Flowfile is not a black box. It outputs clean, version-controllable Python code with no vendor lock-in and is completely free.\n* vs. Notebooks (Jupyter): Instead of disconnected cells, Flowfile shows the entire data flow as a single connected graph. This makes it easier to trace your logic and instantly see the data's schema at any step, so you're never guessing which columns are available downstream.\n\n**How You Can Contribute**\n\nI'm at a point where community feedback and contributions would be incredibly valuable. The [README.md](http://README.md) has a TODO section with my roadmap, and I've set up issue templates to get started.\n\nI'm particularly looking for contributors interested in:\n\n* Cloud Storage Support: Implementing nodes for S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage is a top priority.\n* Testing: Expanding the test suite to ensure the application is robust.\n* Documentation: Helping create more user guides and tutorials to make the project more accessible.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on the project's architecture, its goals, and whether this is a useful tool for the open-source community.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI spend most of my day in the terminal and I've always wanted a simple, keyboard-driven way to track my monthly expenses without reaching for a clunky app or a spreadsheet.\n\nSo, I built **gocost**: a terminal user interface (TUI) for managing your finances. It's written entirely in Go with the wonderful Bubble Tea library.\n\nThe idea was to create something fast, simple, and fully within my control. Your data is stored in a local JSON file, so you own your data.\n\n# Key Features:\n\n* **Keyboard-Driven**: Navigate everything with your keyboard.\n* **Track Income & Expenses**: Manage your income and log expenses for each month.\n* **Organize with Categories**: Create your own expense categories and group them for a clean overview (e.g., \"Utilities\", \"Food\", \"Housing\").\n* **Quick Start**: Use the 'populate' feature to copy all your categories from the previous month to the current one.\n* **Adaptive Theming**: The UI automatically adapts to your terminal's light or dark theme.\n\n**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/madalinpopa/gocost](https://github.com/madalinpopa/gocost)\n\nThe project is fully open-source, and I'm looking for feedback!

    "title": "Thoughts on using Enigma VirtualBox to pack Open Source apps into a single EXE?",
    "selftext": "I'm working on an Open Source WPF project (VB.NET, .NET 8.0). The full source is public, anyone can view, inspect, and build it them selves.\n\nI wanted to distribute it as a simple single EXE for end users (before ending up on some *why no exe* posts 😏 [good times]) . I enabled Self-Contained, Produce Single File, and ReadyToRun in Visual Studio 2022, but as many of you know, WPF apps still leave several native DLLs next to the EXE (e.g., wpfgfx_cor3.dll, PresentationNative_cor3.dll, etc). Microsoft’s \"single file\" option is really \"almost single file\" here.\n\nI dislike the multiple files being shoved into a zip, not like hate, but just want to make it as clean as possible, I want a clean single EXE the user can just plop on their desktop and not worry about shortcuts or having a bunch of random files.\n\nI've been considering using Enigma VirtualBox as a post-process step, it packs the EXE + required DLLs into one file, with no installer needed, no changes to my code (like me adding extra pieces of code). The code remains fully open, anyone can build it from source and verify it.\n\nMy question:\n- How do people in the open source community feel about using tools like Enigma VirtualBox in this way?\n- The packed EXE is just a convenience distribution for those who dont want to mess with source code.\n- The source and instructions to build it yourself would always remain public.\n\nI want to balance transparency + convenience for users, but I’m curious where others draw the line on these kinds of distribution tricks.\n\nThoughts? I know people think Enigma is some sort of weird DRM but I personally never had issues with Enigma related games or executables, but my experience is not what majority of people think.\n\nIf Enigma is not really the goto, then what is the *goto* method of the easy single file distribution.\n\nLink to enigma virtual box https://enigmaprotector.com/en/aboutvb.html",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone 👋\n\nI wanted to share CoreUI — a modern fork of Bootstrap that I’ve been maintaining, which adds full Sass Module support and dedicated libraries for Angular, React.js, and Vue.js.\n\nWhile Bootstrap itself doesn’t yet support Sass Modules, CoreUI solves that by fully modularizing the Sass codebase. No more Sass deprecation warning.\n\n# 💡 What makes CoreUI different from Bootstrap:\n\n* Sass Modules support – no more deprecation warnings\n* Framework-native UI kits – built-from-scratch libraries for React.js, Vue.js, and Angular\n* Ready-to-use Admin Dashboard Templates – for every major framework\n* Open-source under MIT — but with optional Enterprise-grade support\n\nUnlike Bootstrap, which is maintained by the community in their spare time, CoreUI is our full-time job. We’re 100% focused on improving and maintaining it. That means faster updates, professional support options, and long-term reliability for commercial and enterprise projects.\n\n🔗 GitHub: [https://github.com/coreui/coreui](https://github.com/coreui/coreui)  \n📦 NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coreui/coreui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coreui/coreui)  \n🌐 Docs: [https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/getting-started/introduction/](https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/getting-started/introduction/)\n\nWould love your feedback, especially if you're using Bootstrap.",

That the developer makes this possible enables some form of trust towards that developer. But in the case of AI coding, not even the developer himself has read and understand the full code. For me, this makes one of the big reasons to use OSS pretty much meaningless. I'm not going to check software for malice if the developer himself didn't even do that.

More specifically they are valued by the future profits they are expected to return.\n\n\nCode itself is if zero value, the value comes from the potential to make profit, however that is done. That is what all acquirers want, though it can take a few different shapes.\n\n\nProfit comes from revenue which comes from sales. Sales come from the sales funnel, the path you use to convince someone to pay you money. This is very non-trivial, people are reluctant to give you money, things like trials, low cost entry fees and free returns are all mechanisms used to lubricate that funnel.\n\n\nClosed source businesses find it really hard to get folks to enter the funnel. Convincing someone to pay upfront in full is really hard, especially when you are a small unknown company because that is high risk.\n\n\nOpen source companies typically have a really well lubricated funnel opening. They give you the product for free, with almost no restrictions, this gets you lots of users and free marketing. Then you try and extract value, which is hard after you've given the product away. The typical approaches are support of some form or premium features, both cause tension with your open source supporters.\n\n\nFrom a purely commercial perspective the decision is between having a few users who pay a lot or having a lot of users but only a few pay. There are commercial advantages to both paths.\n\n\nFinally it is always pointing out that most new companies never turn a profit. Most new software companies fail without turning a profit, I'm fairly sure that is both open and closed source, neither is a guarantee of success.",

    "title": "I built this CLI tool to copy code for LLMs faster, so you don’t have to do it manually",
    "selftext": "Not sure if this is the right place to post this tool, but I'll give it a shot anyway.\n\nLately, while working on a Rails project inside Cursor, I found myself constantly copying bits of source code from different files into a single `.md` file just so I could ask for help on tools like ChatGPT (o3) or Gemini 2.5 Pro.\n\nIt usually went something like this:\n\n>“Hey, I've got this problem…” *Here's a bunch of code from different files pasted together*\n\nAnd honestly? Doing that over and over got pretty annoying.\n\nSo I built a little tool to speed things up. It's super simple, maybe even a bit dumb—but it's actually helped me a lot.\n\nFor example, if I'm looking into a bug or trying to refactor something, I can run:\n\n    scanex --input=\"app/controllers/app/posts_controller.rb\" > scanex.md\n\nThen it scans the relevant files based on imports or dependencies and bundles them into a Markdown file, like this:\n\n    [scanex] plugin ruby ready\n    [scanex] plugin yaml ready\n    ...\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/controllers/app_controller.rb\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/models/post.rb\n    ✅ processed 7 files\n\nSo why not just use the u/tag feature inside Cursor? Honestly, sometimes I find that just copying the code and pasting it into ChatGPT's web UI o3 gives better, more focused answers. Plus, it's cheaper, ChatGPT gives me 50 free o3 messages a day.\n\nIn another case, I was debugging something in [kamal](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal). I cloned the repo locally and ran at root of the repo:\n\n    scanex > kamal.md\n\n[`kamal.md`](http://kamal.md) contains all source code of kamal repo (exclude test). Then dropped [`kamal.md`](http://kamal.md) into Google AI Studio and asked it questions like:\n\n>“I want to view last 2 days logs”\n\nThat's when I learned the difference between:\n\n    kamal app logs -s 2d\n    kamal app logs -s 48h\n\nTurns out it's about Go's duration format, not Ruby's.\n\nAnd when it’s time to refactor my React frontend, I point scanex at the composer form component, exclude the UI library to keep it focused, and let it pull in everything else:\n\n    scanex --input=\"app/frontend/components/app/posts/composer-form.tsx\" --exclude=\"components/ui\" > composer_form.md\n    \n    [scanex] plugin css ready\n    [scanex] plugin dockerfile ready\n    [scanex] plugin erb ready\n    [scanex] plugin html ready\n    [scanex] plugin javascript ready\n    [scanex] plugin json ready\n    [scanex] plugin markdown ready\n    [scanex] plugin python ready\n    [scanex] plugin ruby ready\n    [scanex] plugin shell ready\n    [scanex] plugin sql ready\n    [scanex] plugin txt ready\n    [scanex] plugin yaml ready\n    [scanex] Repository root detected as: .../rails_social_scheduler\n    [scanex] Loaded tsconfig.json from tsconfig.json for path aliases\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/lib/utils.ts\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/account-selector.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/custom/time-zone-picker.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/custom/time-selector.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/platform-previews-section.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/types/index.ts\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/lib/constants.ts\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/custom/social-platform-icon.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/platform-preview-container.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/platform-preview-adapter.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/platform-previews/facebook-preview.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/platform-previews/instagram-preview.tsx\n    [scanex] ⊕ app/frontend/components/app/posts/platform-previews/tiktok-preview.tsx\n    ✅ processed 14 files\n\nThen I use that `composer_form.md` file as my prompt in ChatGPT o3 to brainstorm improvements or catch sneaky bugs.\n\nI’m still polishing the tool, so apologies in advance for any half-baked code lying around. If you want to give it a spin, you can install it with:\n\n    npm install -g scanex\n\nSource code's here: [https://github.com/darkamenosa/scanex](https://github.com/darkamenosa/scanex)\n\nIf you have feedback or ideas, I'd love to hear it!",

A ubiquitous library whose sole purpose is security had malicious code in publicly released versions for a not-short time.\n\nIt would be a pretty bold claim that other such sabotage doesn't exist elsewhere, and it's a 100% guarantee that innocent vulnerabilities exist in the majority of complex software, some of which are known by one or more bad actors, which they will eventually use when it suits them. That's what a zero-day *is.*\n\nBut is it a valid reason to avoid open source software, in favor of closed-source software? Absolutely not.\n\nIt's a purely academic hypothesis, with no supporting proof and, for the extreme majority of users, not even worth considering.\n\nIf you're actually going to scrutinize the code of the software you use and verify that the binaries you execute actually were produced from the code that you're analyzing, then more power to you. But if you didn't compile it yourself, you're trusting whom you received it from to have compiled it from exactly the source you see. And even if you verify that, are you also going to (or even able to) validate the build toolchain that was used to build it? What about the tool chain used to build that tool chain? What about the one used to build that one? What about the operating systems of the machines those ran on? What about the firmware of all the hardware on those machines?\n\nAnd do you even have the tools, time, knowledge, and experience to do all that?\n\nNo. Nobody does. If someone did, they'd be the most powerful person on the planet in short order.\n\nYou have to draw your trust boundary somewhere. If you trust nothing, you don't get to use your computer.",

I don’t see what could stop an attacker if he has the code you have, unless you tweak it to be secure and you write every single configuration file by yourself.

If you could contribute to the project while maintaining a distance, so by using tools like git. And so, the code in github or whatever isn’t all you need to attack someone?

That's of course completely fine but it also explains why you're a bit confused about the \"source is available\" = \"more secure\" argument.\n\nWhat you seem to find reassuring is what we call \"security through obscurity\". The less details you share about your code, the more secure it is.\n\nLike the previous Redditor said, this argument doesn't hold in computer security. The more people who see your code, the more chances you have that they will find vulnerabilities that you will be able to fix before an attacker finds it. For that reason, it's better that the code is also well written and easy to understand by fellow developers, because if you obfuscate your code, you make it harder for people to help you.\n\nOne big thing is that code isn't inherently insecure. You need a vulnerability to be able to attack a piece of software. If the code is fully secure, it doesn't matter if the attacker has full access to it or to your configuration files. All they can do is go away.\n\nAs an \"uneducated\" user, you would do more harm than good trying to fix what you think is a security issue. IT security is pretty complex and it's easy to introduce new issues when you fix existing ones if you don't know what you're doing.\n\nRegarding your question about GitHub, it depends. Maybe the code is all you need to perform an attack because it's a big issue. Maybe you need shell access. Maybe you need physical access. Maybe you need super specific conditions that will take hours to set up. Maybe you need to overload the target system with requests (DDoS attacks). Maybe you need to exploit another vulnerability to gain sufficient privileges.",

    "selftext": "# Hi everyone!\n\nI'm excited to announce the first release of SYSH, a self-hosted Spotify streaming history dashboard. Think of it as a more in-depth version of Spotify Wrapped, available all year, with detailed statistics, graphs and top lists related to your streaming activity.\n\nGitHub repository: [https://github.com/barmiro/SYSH](https://github.com/barmiro/SYSH)\n\nThe Android app is available for download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.barmiro.syshclient) or on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/barmiro/SYSH/releases). If you're not sure whether SYSH is right for you, the app includes access to a demo server, allowing you to explore its features without the need to set up your own instance.\n\nSYSH was created as a FOSS alternative to existing, commercial services. While they have an impressive user base, they seem to prioritize user engagement and monetization over improving the service or fixing data accuracy issues.\n\nThe project was inspired in part by [Yooooomi/your-spotify](https://github.com/Yooooomi/your_spotify). I wanted to bring similar functionality to a mobile app, accessible on the go, and rethink some design decisions - including the way streaming statistics were calculated.\n\nData is collected both through full streaming history imports and Spotify's recent streaming activity API. Once your account is set up and linked with Spotify, the server will start collecting data about your current streaming activity in the background.\n\nSYSH supports up to around 15 users per instance (detailed info in the GitHub FAQ). Apart from the administrator, users don't need any technical know-how - perfect for friends and family.\n\nFeedback, submissions and feature ideas are welcome! I will probably spend the next couple of weeks cleaning up the code, but I will definitely consider your suggestions in the long term.",

    "selftext": "About a month ago I ran into a weirdly frustrating problem: I had a short video fragment and wanted to find the full source video. Google Lens? Ugh... It only works with still images, and a screenshot doesn’t carry enough context. So I decided to build something myself.\n\nMeet \"Turron\" — a system designed to locate the original video using just a small snippets. Inspired by Shazam, it works by extracting keyframes from the snippet, generating perceptual hashes (using the pHash algorithm), and comparing them against hashes from a known video database using Hamming distance.\n\nYesterday I released v1.0. Right now it works locally with Postgres as the storage backend. In the future, I plan to add:  \n\\* Parallelized Kafka workers for faster indexing and searching;  \n\\* And possibly even web-crawling support to match snippets against online content;\n\nThe code is fully open-source and self-hostable! =\\]\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Fl1s/turron](https://github.com/Fl1s/turron)\n\nWould love to see any tips, feedback, ideas, or collaboration if anyone's interested.",

It would be probably a weeks or months long project even for someone who already enjoyed hardware hacking, had all the tools, and relevant experience. \n\nI've seen some good suggestions already in the comments to go about what you want some other way, I want to add just one more suggestion that would give you almost everything you want, without changing the OS, very simply, and the only sacrifice is that Amazon would still be snooping on you. Just side load the Projectivy Launcher. You can use Downloader to get it, you can transfer the APK from another device with a file storage app or a file manager app, whatever, but if you enable developer options and Install Apps From Unknown Sources, get the APK into your TV, and install it you can tell Projectivy to override the default launcher and then, aesthetically and for most purposes, it looks and feels just like stock Android TV. Side load Aptoide as well and then you're really in business. I've got a TV box here from an ISP that I don't subscribe to and the default launcher is hot garbage, in a language I don't speak, and locked down like Amazon does, but I threw Projectivy on there and you would never know about all that crap and it works great.\n\nWhatever you end up doing I hope you find a good solution for you and you can start enjoying your TV without Amazon's terrible custom ROM causing you any more headaches!",

    "title": "QShift: A Simplified CLI Tool for Quantum Computing",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m excited to introduce **QShift**, a new open-source **CLI tool** designed to make **quantum computing** more accessible and manageable. As quantum technologies grow, interacting with them can be complex, so I wanted to create something that simplifies common tasks like quantum job submission, circuit creation, testing, and more all through a simple command-line interface.\n\nHere’s what **QShift** currently offers:\n\n* **Quantum Job Submission**: Submit quantum jobs (e.g., GroverSearch) to simulators or real quantum devices like IBM Q, AWS Braket, and Azure Quantum.\n* **Circuit Creation & Manipulation**: Easily create and modify quantum circuits by adding qubits and gates.\n* **Interactive Testing**: Test quantum circuits on simulators (like Aer) and view the results.\n* **Cloud Execution**: Execute quantum jobs on real cloud quantum hardware, such as IBM Q, with just a command.\n* **Circuit Visualization**: Visualize quantum circuits in ASCII format, making it easy to inspect and understand.\n* **Parameter Sweep**: Run parameter sweeps for quantum algorithms like VQE and more.\n\nThe tool is built with the goal of **making quantum computing easier to work with**, especially for those just getting started or looking for a way to streamline their workflow.\n\nI’d love to hear feedback and suggestions on how to improve **QShift**! Feel free to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/riverak2/QShift/tree/main/QShift) and contribute if you're interested.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\n",

Out of boredom, I decided to re-invent the wheel by making a machine learning library from scratch in plain C++ without any dependency. I'm writing this post to call for your contribution to my project. [https://github.com/QuanTran6309/NeuralNet](https://github.com/QuanTran6309/NeuralNet)\n\nBy the time I'm writing this post, I have started for 20 days, and I have completed crucial classes like Tensor, Matrix, Dense (in Pytorch they call it Linear). Currently, I plan to implement backpropagation, loss function, and also use CUDA to speed up the matrix operation because right now it is just working on CPU.\n\nI really appreciate any of your contributions or feedback on my project.",

With AI’s help, I managed to get the foundations running: login system, card collection, basic UI... but now I’m hitting a wall, spending more time fixing bugs than actually advancing the project.\n\nThat’s why I’m opening up Apex Collector to the community — to turn this dream into a true collaborative effort.\n\n# 🃏 What is ApexCollector?\n\n**ApexCollector**  isn’t just about collecting car cards — it’s about building a **unique online automotive universe**. Players will be able to:\n\n* ✅ **Open boosters**: Randomized packs with rarity drop rates, event-exclusive editions, and seasonal releases.\n* ✅ **Collect and organize their garage**: Beautiful, high-quality cards inspired by real cars, concept cars, and motorsport history. \n* ✅ **Earn achievements**: Unlock trophies, exclusive boosters, and visual themes for your interface. ✅ **Trade with others**: Use an in-game-only currency to buy, sell, and exchange cards via a built-in **marketplace** (no real money involved). \n* ✅ **Track your progression**: With a visible profile and history of what you’ve unlocked or achieved.\n* And maybe make a way to bring life to the car by creating alive card and making possible to tune the card and making the car more powerfull.\n\n**The whole project is meant to stay free-to-play and ethical, with a clear focus on passion, not monetization.**\n\n\n\n# 🎨 Style and Design\n\nThe visual identity is **elegant, minimal, and motorsport-inspired** — think forged carbon, Kevlar textures, and “gentleman driver” aesthetics. The interface will support unlockable visual themes, giving each player a personalized experience.\n\n\n\n# 💡 Core features (WIP):\n\n  \nThis is what the AI have make in place for the project. I think it's a total mess and hesitate to reset all and restrat from scratch :\n\n* Supabase authentication system ✅\n* React + Next.js frontend (hosted on Vercel) ✅\n* Husky\n* Collection & marketplace UI in progress 🔧\n* Booster opening animation system (planned) 🎁\n* Achievement and profile system (planned) 🏆\n* Themed UI unlocks through progression 🌐\n\n# 👥 Who am I looking for?\n\nI’m looking for devs (frontend/backend), UI designers, or just anyone excited by this idea. Whether you love cars, games, or just building fun open-source projects — **you’re welcome to jump in**.\n\n# 🔗 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/iBob78/Apex-collector\n\nThe roadmap and ideas : \n  \nhttps://github.com/iBob78/Apex-collector/issues/5\n\nWebsite : \n\nhttps://silver-bassoon-vwgr66g5qqgfp45g-3000.app.github.dev/\n\n\n\nLet me know if you're interested — I'd love to share the full vision and roadmap. Let's build something awesome together!",

    "selftext": "Hey buddies, this is my first post here, so please be lenient towards me :)\n\nSo, the thought process behind this post is that, i am, in  general really pissed about the privacy concerns of big companies such as Google, Microsoft, etc. What i was thinking about is, why cant we, the open source community come together and challenge those trillion dollar organizations? Remember, we are surely capable of doing this, and the biggest example of this would be the case of Wall Street Bets. \n\nNow, i am not saying that we arent doing anything or that we arent building any open source platforms. We are. But my biggest complaint is the lack of coordination, compatibility and partnerships. \n\nImagine the example of Google. They have a big suite of apps and services that they shove down our throats. We have a lot of open source alternatives but they are scattered and unknown to most people. Remember, if we want to make FOSS the norm, we need to make the normies(with all due respect) our prime target/prime userbase, and not just the nerds. \n\nImagine if we all just come together and start creating and FULL and FUNCTIONAL system of services like Google or MS, with integration and partnerships with other softwares. As of today, the open source community stands very fragmented and busy with their own separate projects (with a few exceptions ofc, we are talking about the norm, and NOT the exceptions).\n\nI just want to contribute to this idea and ecosystem, and want to create services that feel like an entire package instead of just fragmented alternatives to some paid software. I want open source to become mainstream and the norm. \n\nWe have everything in the open source community - Veterans, newbie coders, moderately experienced people, Industry experts and EVEN the Millionaires and Billionaires. We can all pool our resources together and create a unified experience instead of singular, unorganized projects. \n\nSo, I want ideas from you all. lets try to focus on this idea and create something out of it. It wont be something immediate, it will take time, but lets just start with something. \n\nI hope i could put out my point clearly and have not said anything wrong. If i did, feel free to correct me. Drop your ideas in the comments and let me know if anyone is willing to work in this project and what we all can contribute. I want to hear everyone's opinions. \n\n  \nTL;DR - Not satisfied with open source community being fragmented. Want the projects and services to give out a unified experience, not only to the nerds but also to the normies. ",

Much of the open source that people love, is because it's folks working on what they enjoy or their passion. That's harder to do as a project gets bigger, especially if your pushing developers to work on something instead of them enjoying creating what the want to or believe in. It's easy to think it's just a re-direction of efforts, but the reality is not so simple and the issues grow exponentially with size.\n\nEven if you did manage to solve the technical side, it does not mean it will be used or succeed to capture the wider (non-nerd) codebase, since it existing does not mean folks will care or use it. There's a massive and expensive marketing portion to it as well, which then relies on funding, which can bring tensions and complications into open source development when the balance of money vs open rights gets involved. \n\nGenerally I disagree that large central projects are the answer and, for the goals of better privacy and anti-monopolisation, that it's probably more productive to put efforts into advocating such things to governments so that legislation can tackle these issues.",

Although the data is music-related, **Yambda** is designed for evaluating virtually all RecSys algorithms, not just those connected to streaming services.\n\n\n\nAs many of you know, recent progress in RecSys has stalled — few high-quality datasets are available that approximate **real-world production loads**. The most popular datasets, including **LFM-1B**, **LFM-2B**, and **MLHD-27B**, are now off-limits due to licensing restrictions. **Criteo’s 4B ad dataset** was the largest of its kind until recently, but **Yambda** has now topped it with an additional **800 million interaction events**.\n\n\n\n🔍 **What’s inside:**\n\n\n\n* 3 dataset sizes: **50M**, **500M**, and **full 5B events**  \n* **GTS evaluation** for sequence benchmarking, with **baseline algorithms** for reference\n\n\n\n* **is\\_organic** flag to differentiate between **organic** and **recommended actions**  \n* **Parquet format** compatible with **Pandas, Polars, and Spark**\n\n\n\nWe believe this dataset could be an extremely useful resource, a potential game-changer for anyone working on **recommender systems**.

    "selftext": "I am currently using a GPL3 licensed piece of software, openly available on Github, in several projects at work.  However, a few years back, the company that developed this free software ceased open-source development, and took it closed-source. You can still download the older, open-source versions on github, but to get the latest versions, you must now visit the company's website and fill out an online form to download the software. \n\nI don't remember precisely right now, but I think if you indicate on the form that you work for a private company, they attempt to charge you money for the program. However, I had a colleague who works for a university download the software, and that colleague confirmed it is distributed now as binary-only. Thus, you can no longer get the source code of their new modified versions.\n\nMy question is: can they do this? Is this a violation of the GPL, or am I totally mistaken here?

Recipients of the older copy of the code can fork the project and continue development as long as they comply with the rest of the GPL, such as releasing their modifications as GPL as well. \n\n\nIf the codebase are written entirely by the company and they never received any outside contributions, then they likely can stop releasing any further changes as GPL as they're the sole copyrights holder for all the code they've written. The GPL is a licence that works under copyright law and license restrictions applies to recipient of the licence, not the copyright owner who issues the license.\n\n\nIf the codebase ever received outside contributions, then things become quite murky, since the company now is also a recipient of GPL licensed code from the outside contributor. The company have to comply with the GPL restrictions applied to them.\n\n\n\nI think the company likely can take the software off GPL if they removed all external contributions. This is really only practical for software that had only received trivial external contributions or if external contributions are fairly well isolated. In projects where there's non trivial number of external contributions, it is going to be practically impossible to untangle the external contributions out of the codebase. Alternatively, the other way that they can relicense the project to a different license here, proprietary or not, is if all the external contributors agreed to relicense their contributions into the project to the original developer or if they had made external contributors sign a CLA that allows them to relicense the project to proprietary. ",

Curious about PCI implications and why you think they are necessary for just UPI Collect Requests.\n\n  \nAlso, the most important Q: How and where are you interfacing with the actual banking infrastructure? To raise a UPI Collect Request, you need to talk to a sponsor bank, I couldn't find the code that does this. As I've written that code in the past, that is where most of the complexity lies, the rest is just building a transaction system. UPI Collect APIs are also not considered onerous to obtain from a partner bank, since you're only applying for a single terminal. The real security and compliance problems show up when you try to run an aggregator as a backing for multiple merchants. Since this is a single-merchant system, I think you're fighting the wrong problems.\n\n  \n(I'm in BLR, and active in the FOSS/Fintech space. I've been working towards an open-source client-side UPI stack for eg: [https://librefin.in](https://librefin.in), as well as publishing fintech-open-data). If you're really serious about making this into a real competitor, I suggest looking at BalancedPayments. Happy to have a chat.",

You can help us through [joinpeertube.org/contribute](https://joinpeertube.org/contribute).\n\n**We develop PeerTube**\n\n>In the English-speaking community, we are mostly known for developing [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/), a **self-hosted video and live-streaming free/libre platform**, which has become **the main alternative to Big Tech's video platforms**.\n\n>From a student project to a software with international reach, our video platform solution is now, seven years later, used and acknowledged by many institutions!\n\n>The last major version of PeerTube, v7, [has been released](https://joinpeertube.org/news/release-7.0) at the end of 2024, along with the first version of the official mobile app, available on both Android ([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.framasoft.peertube), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.framasoft.peertube/)) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/en/app/peertube/id6737834858).\n\n>Now that the PeerTube platform has matured significantly over successive versions, we believe that the way to enable even more people to use PeerTube is to improve the mobile app so that it can be carried around in people's pockets.\n\n**Ask Us Anything!**\n\n>Last month, we have [published the roadmap for the project](https://joinpeertube.org/news/roadmap-2025). Two weeks ago, we also [launched our new crowdfunding campaign](https://support.joinpeertube.org/) which focuses on our mobile app. We want to give you the opportunity through this AMA to give us feedback on the product and the project and discuss the crowdfunding campaign and our next steps!\n\n>If you have any questions, please ask them below (and upvote those you want us to answer first).\n\n>We will answer them to the best of our abilities with the u/Framasoft account, from June. 11th 2025 5pm CEST (11 am EST) until we are too tired ;).\n\nEDIT 5:05 p.m CEST: We're starting to answer your questions!\n\n>Thanks for all of your questions! We hope we have provided you with all the answers you need.\n>\n>If you want to support PeerTube and the development of its mobile app, head over to [our crowdfunding page](https://support.joinpeertube.org), there's a few days left!\n>\n>You can also spread the word so that more people install the app and discover PeerTube. <3",

I have two lingering questions.\n\nHow should one approach instancing? I get that anyone can make any instance that they want, but ideally, are instances niche and specialized, then becoming something broader as a federation? For example, does a broad instance for the EU make sense? Or is best practise always niche, and then federalize?\n\nAnother confusion is how to think about user account details. As I understand, my user account details is stored on the server running the instance. However if Johnny ServerAdmin is running his server in a semi-proffessional way, then I should probably not get too invested in setting my profile up. IE losing 150 subscriptions or whatever. I  assume video doesn't matter, because you have them locally, but a content creator might have to re-publish them on another instance no? So the **real** question is, doesn't best practice become to find the most professionally run instance, maybe even on that only holds accounts and then tries follows as many content creators as possible? Is it maybe possible to just transfer settings and subscriptions from user to user?",

If nobody posts to peertube, then it's little more than an interesting project -\n\nSo, here's my question.\n\nIn a broader sense, what's your answer to the strategy question of getting more people on the platform? Could something like making it easier for viewers to pay for content they like work? Could just raising awareness and outreach work?

If you want to build your own instance, you'll need to consider how it will grow and how much storage you can afford. That's why many small instances limit registrations. We discussed storage limitations [in another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1l31dhy/comment/mx7nylt/).\n\nHowever, we developed PeerTube features that allow admins to share resources. For example, transcoding can be expensive in terms of CPU usage, but you can [create remote runners ](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/remote-runners#remote-runners)and share them between multiple instances, thus sharing the cost We know of multiple organizations that are already doing this! You can also use [platform redundancy](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/following-instances#platforms-redundancy) to share your bandwidth with other instances.\n\nTherefore, if you collaborate with others, you can create a large PeerTube platform and share the cost.\n\nConcerning the investment in your account, you can export/import your account from one instance to another one. However, your followers won't be saved. We would like to develop a transfer feature but that's not that easy since we have to think about a lot of constraints. If you really care about your followers, I would say it's important to start your journey on a well-maintained platform and provide them financial support (most of them accept donations). Otherwise, they may disappear due to a lack of funding.",

We're realistic; we can't compete with one of the world's richest companies. We're just a small nonprofit organization with ten employees, only two of whom work full time on PeerTube, and twenty-five volunteers.\nHowever, our goal is to build something that aligns with our values. We believe that by building PeerTube, we're creating spaces where people can feel better than on YouTube. At some point, they may decide to make the switch and start using PeerTube.\n\nWe'll never have YouTube's or Vimeo's marketing strength to attract millions of people to our platform in a week. We need to think long-term.\n\nSo, yeah.\nFirst, we're trying to build the best software possible with our resources. We want PeerTube to be really helpful to people. We won't strictly copy YouTube, and we'll avoid dark patterns that keep people captive to the platform. For example, there won't be a timer at the end of your videos, and the next video won't play automatically unless you decide to play it. You can share video clips that stop whenever you want.\nWe want PeerTube to be software that people use because it's useful, not because we made it addictive.\n\nNext, we consider how to reduce the friction of using PeerTube. That's why we started working with a design team called La Coopérative des Internets to help us build PeerTube's new design.\nThe difficulty with PeerTube (and other Fediverse software) is that it's decentralized. This is disconcerting for most people who are accustomed to using only centralized software in their daily lives.\nOne of our challenges is helping people understand that they're using a decentralized tool while making them feel like they're using a centralized one.\nWe are making slow progress, and we still have a lot of work to do!\nThis is one of the reasons why we decided to work on the mobile app. We think it will help many people discover PeerTube and start using it.\n\nAdditionally, as the PeerTube community grows, we can hope that PeerTube will reach an even wider audience. More and more diverse content is being shared on PeerTube, and more and more institutions are starting to use it too, helping the software become known by non-tech-savvy people.\n\nI hope I answered your question properly. Let me know if I didn't! Haha!",

Most of my teachers were also fairly positive towards open-source as well, a few being major contributors on large projects.\n\nThe government recently implemented a system called France Connect that unifies authentification across nearly all governmental services, and that system is open-source.",

It's the regular fundraising campaign we do at the end of each year that brings us much more income than this particular crowdfunding we're doing on the PeerTube mobile app topic. Hence, we were able to provide the initial funds to develop PeerTube at a loss for a while, which isn't something most open-source projects can do. So it's much harder for a new project to step in and ask for like a year's salary to work on something, without having anything to show or having an history of delivering promises.\n\nOf course, like most projects, we are required to primarily work on shiny new features that we can announce rather than spending time on bug fixes, refactoring, or maintenance. Financing open-source software in general stays a challenge for everyone.\n\nTo answer the question more specifically, we would recommend starting by creating a legal structure to organize fundraising, then working on the project vision and storytelling for fundraising campaigns to reach as many people as possible. We believe that recruiting a communications specialist early on in Framasoft's history was crucial to our success so far, as was paying [David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com) for his magnificent illustrations.",

Also, ads on YouTube don't pay much creators these days, hence all the sponsoring.

I already have a setup for that on Notion but i want to move away from it because I am fed up with cloud services, the logins, the bloat etc. Also, Notion it's pretty slow.  \nI was looking for something open source, possibly using markdown or other accessible document type for storing data. The functionalities it'd need to have are:  \nHaving a list of books, each with some properties (title, author, my rating, genre...)  \nShowing the list, possibly as a table with editable queries   \nHaving a list of quotes from the books (each with the quote itself, but also the page and the genre)  \nShowing each quote both in another table and in the page of the book it is from  \nHaving some form of mobile support. Now, this is tricky, but i don't need a cloud mobile app, I was thinking about having a text file that can be opened in some markdown mobile app while still mantaining most of the features. I don't really need syncronization (I don't read that much sigh)\n\nSo... I know this is a lot, but if you have any ideas of programs, githubs repositories or whatever that can do this it'd be great. I can also somewhat code so if you had any idea about a simple way to set this up myself it would be useful as well.",

Supabase is as userfriendly and clean you'll get in that aspect. You could look using something like [logto.io](http://logto.io) if you want to refactor your authentication provider out of supabase. There's the more contemporary options like Auth0 and what have you, or you could just nextjs BetterAuth straight into some Drizzle for local auth too.\n\nAlso I'm not trying to shoebox Drizzle into this local only option. It can be delivered whichever way you want if you'd rather it were abstracted in a cloud providers infrastructure and you can hook it up via API. I personally don't know of anything as clear or easy as Supabase or Appwrite but maybe look at Turso? It's libSQL which is SQLite but if you're not needing the depth of PostgreSQL it might work for you? Also I haven't looked at your post history so I'm not sure what your context is.\n\n  \nEdit: You might like geldata",

I wanted an open-source way to get that same deep, structural understanding.\n\nThat's why I built [Code-to-Knowledge-Graph](https://github.com/Bevel-Software/code-to-knowledge-graph).\n\nIt uses VS Code's Language Server Protocol (LSP) to parse your whole project and builds a detailed knowledge graph – capturing all your functions, classes, variables, and how they call, inherit, or reference each other. This graph is the \"codebase-level context\" to improve coding agents at scale.\n\nThe idea was inspired by research showing that knowledge graphs significantly improve retrieval-augmented generation and structural reasoning (such as \"Knowledge Graph-Augmented Language Models\" (Zhang et al., 2022 and \"GraphCodeBERT\")\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or ideas for improvement!",

The system drives multiple servos (eyes, jaw, neck, torso, and hands) via PCA9685 servo drivers and communicates with custom joystick controllers over ESP-NOW for low-latency control.\n\nI’ve made all the code, wiring diagrams, and design notes publicly available so others can build, modify, or improve upon it.

I wanted something minimal, local, and Git-friendly; so I built this.\n\nEvalGit:\n\n\\- Stores evaluation results (per model + dataset) in SQLite- Lets you query logs and generate Markdown reports\n\n\\- Makes it easy to version your metrics and document progress\n\n\\- No dashboards. No login. Just a reproducible local flow.It’s open-source, early-stage, and I’d love thoughts or contributions from others who care about reliable, local-first ML tooling.\n\nIf you are a student who wants to get more hands-on experience this project can help you.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/fadlgh/evalgit](https://github.com/fadlgh/evalgit)\n\nIf you’ve ever written evaluation metrics to a .txt file and lost it two weeks later, this might help.

    "title": "Phoenix Template Engine for Spring v1.0.0 is here!",
    "selftext": "**LE: Project renamed to Flamewing**\n\nWith some delay, but I made it. I'm happy to announce that Phoenix Template Engine version 1.0.0 is now available. This is the first version that I consider stable and that comes with the functionalities I wanted. Moreover, I spent time on a complete rebranding, where I redesigned the logo, the presentation website, and the documentation.\n\n# What is Flamewing?\n\nPhoenix is an open-source template engine created entirely by me for Spring and Spring Boot that comes with functionalities that don't exist in other market solutions. Furthermore, Phoenix is the fastest template engine, significantly faster than the most used solutions such as Thymeleaf or Freemarker.\n\n# What makes Flamewing different?\n\nBesides the functions you expect from a template engine, Phoenix also comes with features that you won't find in other solutions. Just a few of the features offered by Phoenix:\n\n* An easy-to-use syntax that allows you to write Java code directly in the template. It only takes one character (the magical `@`) to differentiate between HTML and Java code.\n* The ability to create components (fragments, for those familiar with Thymeleaf) and combine them to create complex pages. Moreover, you can send additional HTML content to a fragment to customize the result even more.\n* Reverse Routing (type-safe routing) allows the engine to calculate a URL from the application based on the Controller and input parameters. This way, you won't have to manually write URLs, and you'll always have a valid URL. Additionally, if the mapping in the Controller changes, you won't need to modify the template.\n* Fragments can insert code in different parts of the parent template by defining sections. This way, HTML and CSS code won't mix when you insert a fragment. Of course, you can define whatever sections you want.\n* You can insert a fragment into the page after it has been rendered. Phoenix provides REST endpoints through which you can request the HTML code of a fragment. Phoenix handles code generation using SSR, which can then be added to the page using JavaScript. This way, you can build dynamic pages without having to create the same component in both Phoenix and a JS framework.\n* Access to the Spring context to use Beans directly in the template. Yes, there is `@autowired` directly in the template.\n* Open-source\n* And many other features that you can discover on the site.\n\n# Want to learn more?\n\nPhoenix is open-source. You can find the entire code at [https://github.com/pazvanti/Flamewing](https://github.com/pazvanti/Flamewing)\n\nSource code: [https://github.com/pazvanti/Flamewing](https://github.com/pazvanti/Flamewing)  \nDocumentation: [https://pazvanti.github.io/Flamewing/](https://pazvanti.github.io/Flamewing/)  \nBenchmark source code: [https://github.com/pazvanti/Flamewing-Benchmarks](https://github.com/pazvanti/Flamewing-Benchmarks)",

    "title": "# The Reference Data Problem That's Been Driving Developers Crazy (And How I Think I Finally Fixed It?)",
    "selftext": "EDIT: After getting a lot of feedback, I have rebranded the solution name to RefWire from ListServ which has been causing some confusion.\n\n*TL;DR: I got so fed up with the painful process of managing reference data in projects that I built an entire ecosystem to solve it once and for all. Here's what happened, and why it might change how you handle lookup tables forever.*\n\n## The Problem That Broke My Back\n\nPicture this: You're building a new microservice. Everything's going great until you need to add a simple country dropdown. \"No big deal,\" you think. \"I'll just grab some country data.\"\n\nTwo hours later, you're:\n- Digging through sketchy GitHub gists with outdated data\n- Trying to figure out which CSV from a government site is actually current\n- Wondering if \"Macedonia\" or \"North Macedonia\" is correct this week\n- Debating whether to hardcode it or spin up another database table\n\nSound familiar? \n\nThis exact scenario happened to me for the dozenth time last year, and I finally snapped. Not at my computer (okay, maybe a little), but at the absurd state of reference data management in 2024.\n\n## The Madness of Modern Reference Data\n\nHere's what we've all been putting up with:\n\n### The Scavenger Hunt Problem\nNeed currencies? Go hunt through some random API that might be down tomorrow. Need ISO codes? Find a dusty CSV file and pray it's not from 2015. Need industry classifications? Good luck finding anything that doesn't require a PhD in library science to understand.\n\n### The \"Just Another CRUD App\" Problem  \n\"I'll just build a quick admin panel,\" you say. Fast forward three weeks: you've written models, controllers, validation, tests, authentication, deployment configs... all for a table that changes twice a year.\n\n### The Synchronization Nightmare\nYou have five microservices that all need the same country data. Now you have five different versions of \"the truth,\" and somehow they're all wrong in different ways.\n\n### Then Embedded Pattern\nYou decide to use a Nuget dataset library with countries but what happens when you need the same data in your NodeJS server application where you can't use a dotnet specific library for example? You then check to see if there is something similar on NPM. Let's say you do find one and then you realize the data structure isn't compatible? Then it's time to write some script to convert it to the same format. Good, see, it's resolved but then a few weeks in you need to add a new dataset. Wash, rinse repeat...\n\n### The Security Afterthought\nMost reference data just sits there, unversioned, unsigned, and unvalidated. Did someone tamper with your country codes? Was that currency file actually from your data team? Who knows!\n\n### The Discovery Black Hole\nEven when good datasets exist, finding them is impossible. There's no central place to discover, compare, or evaluate reference data. It's like the early days of programming before package managers existed.\n\n## The \"Aha!\" Moment\n\nAfter dealing with this pain for the hundredth time, I had a realization: **We solved this exact problem for code libraries decades ago.**\n\nThink about it:\n- **Before npm/NuGet**: You downloaded random ZIP files from forums, copied code from blogs, and prayed it worked\n- **After npm/NuGet**: `npm install lodash` and you're done. Versioned, secure, discoverable, manageable\n\nBut for data? We're still in the stone age.\n\nThat's when it hit me: **What if we could do `npm install countries` but for datasets?**\n\n## Enter the RefWire Ecosystem\n\nI didn't just build a tool—I have tried to build an entire ecosystem to solve this problem properly. It has three main parts:\n\n### 1. RefWire: The High-Performance Data API Engine\n\nRefWire is like having a professional API team manage your reference data, but without the team:\n\n```bash\n# Deploy in literally 30 seconds\ndocker run -d -p 7010:80 coretravis/refwire:latest\n\n# Add your first dataset\nnpm install -g @coretravis/refwire\n\nrefwire dataset list-ids \n# Prompts for your server details: ServerUrl, ApiKey, RegistryUrl\n\nrefwire dataset pull currencies\n\n# You now have a production-ready API with:\n# - Rate limiting\n# - API key security  \n# - CORS handling\n# - Intelligent caching\n# - Full-text search\n# - Distributed orchestration\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Smart Caching**: In-memory caching with intelligent eviction and suffix tree indexing for lightning-fast searches\n- **Pluggable Storage**: Works with Azure Blob Storage, local file system, or bring your own provider\n- **Production Ready**: Built-in security, rate limiting, health checks, and distributed coordination\n- **Zero Config**: Point it at JSON data and get a full-featured API instantly\n\n### 2. RefPack: The \"npm for Data\" Standard\n\nThis is where it gets really interesting. I created a complete experimenental specification(which will benefit from contributions and ideas from the community) for how reference data should be packaged, versioned, and distributed:\n\n```\nyour-dataset-1.0.0.refpack.zip\n├── data.meta.json          ← Manifest (ID, version, authors, etc.)\n├── data.meta.json.jws      ← Cryptographic signature  \n├── data.json               ← Your actual data\n├── data.schema.json        ← JSON Schema validation\n├── data.changelog.json     ← Version history\n├── data.readme.md          ← Documentation\n└── assets/                 ← Extra files (images, CSVs, etc.)\n```\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- **Signed & Secure**: Every package is cryptographically signed with JWS. You know it hasn't been tampered with\n- **Semantic Versioning**: SemVer 2.0.0 means you can safely upgrade or rollback data just like code\n- **Schema Validation**: Built-in JSON Schema ensures data quality\n- **Audit Trail**: Complete changelog and authorship tracking for compliance\n- **Universal Format**: One ZIP format that works everywhere\n\nThe CLI makes it dead simple:\n```bash\n# Scaffold a new dataset - This also generates signing keys if you so desire\nrefpack scaffold --output ./my-refpack --id myid --title \"My Dataset\" --author \"Your Name\"\n\n# Pack and sign your data \nrefpack pack --input ./my-data --sign-key ~/.keys/publisher.pem --key-id $(cat ./my-refpack/key-id.txt)\n\n# Validate before publishing  \nrefpack validate --package my-data-1.0.0.refpack.zip --verbose\n\n# Publish to registry\nrefpack push --package my-data-1.0.0.refpack.zip --api-url https://registry.company.com --api-key $REFPACK_TOKEN\n```\n\n### 3. RefStor: The Public Gallery of Curated Datasets\n\nBut here's the best part—I didn't just create the infrastructure. I am populating it with curated, standardized datasets at [stor.refwire.online](https://stor.refwire.online). I am only one person though, so this is where the community comes in. I promise at least two datasets a day so it should be about 50 - 60 solid datasets in a month's time. For now, RefWire can still be used directly with your JSON files as it doesn't rely exclusively on RefPacks to work. You can just import your existing JSON files for now.\n\n**Categories Include:**\n- **Core Standards**: Countries, currencies, languages, units of measure\n- **Geographic**: Administrative hierarchies, postal codes, time zones\n- **Business**: Industry codes, bank identifiers, market classifications  \n- **IT Systems**: File types, protocols, HTTP status codes, error categories\n- **Security**: Encryption standards, compliance frameworks, risk scoring\n- **Medical**: ICD codes, drug classifications, medical devices\n- **Academic**: Degree types, publication standards, research classifications\n\nEvery dataset is:\n- ✅ Professionally curated and validated\n- ✅ Cryptographically signed for integrity\n- ✅ Semantically versioned with changelogs\n- ✅ Instantly deployable via CLI\n- ✅ Ready for production use\n\n## Real-World Impact: Before vs. After\n\n### Before RefWire/RefPack:\n```bash\n# The old way (painful)\n1. Google \"country codes JSON\"\n2. Find random GitHub gist from 2019\n3. Copy/paste into your code\n4. Realize it's missing South Sudan\n5. Find another source\n6. Write validation logic\n7. Build CRUD interface for updates\n8. Deploy and manage infrastructure\n9. Repeat for every microservice\n10. Pray nothing breaks in production\n```\n\n### After RefWire/RefPack:\n```bash\n# The new way (delightful)\ndocker run -d -p 7010:80 coretravis/refwire:latest\nrefwire dataset pull countries\n\n# Fetch countries\ncurl http://localhost:7050/datasets/countries/items/0/10\n\n# Fetch countries with nativeName and iso3 fields and include airports\ncurl http://localhost:7050/datasets/countries/items/0/10?includeFields=nativeName,iso3&link=airports-country_iso2\n\n# Fetch a particular country by a unique ID\ncurl http://localhost:7050/datasets/countries/items/{itemId}\n\n# Fetch multiple countries by ID's\ncurl http://localhost:7050/datasets/countries/items/search-by-ids\n\n# Done. You have a production-ready API.\n```\n\n## The Technicalities Behind the Scenes\n\n### Intelligent Performance Optimization\nRefWire isn't just a JSON file server. It uses:\n- **Suffix Tree Indexing**: For lightning-fast text searches across large datasets\n- **Sliding Window Caching**: Keeps frequently accessed data in memory while efficiently evicting stale data, which for reference data is rare.\n- **Preloading Strategies**: Critical datasets can be loaded at startup to eliminate cold start delays\n\n### Enterprise-Grade Security Model\nThe RefPack security model rivals what you'd find in enterprise software:\n- **JWS Signatures**: Every manifest is signed using JSON Web Signatures (RFC 7515)\n- **Key Rotation**: JWKS endpoint support for enterprise key management\n- **ZIP Sanitization**: Prevents path traversal attacks and malicious payloads\n- **Schema Validation**: Both manifest and payload validation against JSON Schema\n- *This area most definitely will benefit from your eyes and opinions*\n\n### Distributed Orchestration  \nRefWire supports multi-instance deployments with leader/follower coordination:\n- **Pluggable Backends**: Azure Blob Storage provider included, bring your own orchestration layer\n- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failover and recovery mechanisms\n- **Lease-Based Leadership**: Prevents split-brain scenarios in distributed deployments\n\n## Why This Matters More Than You Think\n\n### For Individual Developers\nYou'll never waste time hunting for reference data again. `refwire dataset pull currencies` and you're done.\n\n### For Teams  \nConsistent, versioned reference data across all your services. No more synchronization nightmares.\n\n### For Enterprises\nComplete audit trails, cryptographic integrity, and compliance-ready data governance. Your auditors will actually smile.\n\n### For the Industry\nWe're establishing the foundation for treating data as a first-class citizen in software development, just like we do with code libraries.\n\n## Real-World Use Cases Already Happening\n\n### FinTech Startup\n\"We needed bank identifier codes, currency exchange metadata, and regulatory compliance codes. Instead of spending weeks building data pipelines, we pulled three RefPacks and had everything running in an afternoon.\"\n\n### Healthcare Platform  \n\"Medical coding standards are insanely complex. Having ICD-10, drug classifications, and medical device codes available as validated, signed packages saved us months of data curation work.\"\n\n### E-commerce Platform\n\"We have 12 microservices that all need the same product taxonomy and country data. RefWire keeps everything in sync, and the schema validation catches data issues before they hit production.\"\n\n### Government Agency\n\"Audit compliance requires knowing exactly when data changed and who changed it. RefPack's signed manifests and changelogs give us the complete audit trail our regulators demand.\"\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nThis is just the beginning. Here's what's coming:\n\n### Short Term\n- **Language SDKs**: Auto-generated strongly-typed clients for popular languages\n- **IDE Integrations**: IntelliSense support for RefPack datasets  \n- **CI/CD Plugins**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins integrations\n\n### Medium Term\n- **Private Registries**: Enterprise-hosted RefPack repositories\n- **Data Lineage**: Track data provenance and transformation chains\n- **Smart Validation**: ML-powered data quality checks\n\n### Long Term\n- **Universal Data Catalog**: The definitive registry for all reference data\n- **Automated Curation**: AI-assisted dataset discovery and validation\n- **Industry Standards**: Working with standards bodies to establish RefPack as the canonical format\n\n## Get Started Right Now\n\nThe best part? You can start using this immediately:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Deploy RefWire\ndocker run -d -p 7010:80 coretravis/refwire:latest\n\n# 2. Install the CLI\nnpm install -g @coretravis/refwire\n\n# 3. Configure (one time only)\nrefwire dataset list-ids\n\n# Enter RefWire Server Url: http://localhost:7010\n# Enter RefWire ApiKey: ThisIsTheApiKey (Demo only)\n# Enter RefStor/Refpack Registry Url: `https://refpack.refwire.online` (You can build and use yours for a private registry)\n\n# 4. Add datasets (Check RefWire CLI for full options)\nrefwire dataset pull countries\nrefwire dataset pull currencies  \nrefwire dataset pull languages\n\n# 5. Use your APIs\ncurl http://localhost:7050/datasets/countries/items/0/10\ncurl http://localhost:7050/datasets/countries/items/0/10?includeFields=nativeName,iso3&link=airports-country_iso2\n```\n\nBoom. You now have professional-grade reference data APIs with zero setup time.\n\n## Join the Movement\n\nBrowse available datasets at [stor.refwire.online](https://stor.refwire.online) or create and add some\n\nCheck out the code:\n- **RefWire**: [github.com/coretravis/RefWire](https://github.com/coretravis/RefWire)\n- **RefPack CLI**: [github.com/coretravis/RefPackNodeCLI](https://github.com/coretravis/RefPackNodeCLI)\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nI built this because I was tired of the same stupid problems occurring over and over again. Reference data management shouldn't be this hard in 2024.\n\nWe have incredible infrastructure for managing code dependencies. We have sophisticated CI/CD pipelines. We have enterprise-grade security and monitoring.\n\nBut for data? We're still copying and pasting from random websites.\n\n**That ends now.**\n\nRefWire, RefPack, and RefStor represent the future of reference data: secure, versioned, discoverable, and delightfully easy to use.\n\nTry it out. I guarantee it'll save you time on your very first project. And if you find it useful, spread the word. Let's fix this problem for everyone.\n\n*Note: RefPack is still under heavy development but RefWire is pretty good as it stands. Did I also mention you are not restricted to using RefPacks. You can literally point RefWire to a JSON array file and get the same featues running via the RefWireCLI*\n\n- I Feel like once RefPack is completely ready, at least first release, we can then bombard the official repository with Standardized ready to use datasets.\n---\n\n*Questions? Ideas? Want to contribute? Reach out at info@coretravis.work or open an issue on GitHub. Let's build the future of reference data together.*",

    "selftext": "\nI've been looking for a solution to a specific problem for my company, and I recently came across an open source project that fits our needs perfectly. However, the project hasn't been actively developed for about 6–8 months.\n\nI submitted a few pull requests to improve and adapt the tool, but it's been over a week and there's been no response. I also emailed the maintainer directly, but I haven’t heard back.\n\nI did some digging and found a blog post from the author where he mentioned that he originally built the tool for his own company’s cloud migration, which makes me think he may no longer be motivated to continue maintaining it.\n\nHere’s my dilemma:\n\nMy company needs this tool, and I’d love to maintain and develop it further.\n\nI genuinely enjoy working on it, and I’d like to turn this into a side project and potentially add it to my resume.\n\nBut I also don’t want to step on anyone’s toes or split the community unnecessarily.\n\n\nShould I:\n\n1. Fork the project, start maintaining it under a new name, and build a small community around it?\n\n\n2. Wait longer and hope the original maintainer gets back to me?\n\n\n3. Is there an appropriate way to “take over” or “adopt” an inactive project respectfully?\n\n\n\nWould appreciate advice from anyone who's dealt with something similar.\n",

But also it's not a regular project - instead getting dev attention when needed or seasonally.\n\nHalf a year since the last release means it's not really an *active* project, but it's a stretch to call it *unmaintained*. If I had a busy week I definitely might put off responding to people reaching out about a low-priority project.\n\nIt's totally fine for you to fork the repo. There's already 40 forks, probably even less maintained than the main one. Normally one makes their own forks to package PRs, do their own builds, etc for their own needs while the main project catches up. That's how git workflows work. Forking the *repo* is not an attack. Forking the *project* is a somewhat different thing.\n\nI'd recommend not changing things all over the place to make it *your* project in a fork. Keep it easy to synchronize with the main project and give the maintainer a month, maybe two. Reach out every 2 weeks or so and make it clear that you know they might be busy, but you also appreciate their work and don't want to step on their toes.\n\nI wouldn't ask to take over *ownership* of the project.

Think of it as a digital lab where software is:\n\n* Experimental\n* High-performance\n* OS-integrated\n* Occasionally... a little unhinged 😈\n\nWe specialize in small but sharp tools — things like:\n\n* DLL loaders\n* Spectral analyzers\n* Phantom CLI utilities\n* Cognitive-inspired frameworks ...and anything that feels like it was smuggled from a future operating system.\n\n🎯 **Our Philosophy**\n\n>\n\n✨ **MIT Licensed. Community-driven. Tech-forward.**  \nWe're looking for collaborators, testers, idea-throwers, and minds that like wandering the weird edge of code.\n\n🚀 First microtool is out: [PyDLLManager](https://github.com/AtomixCore/PyDLLManager)  \nIt’s a DLL handler for Python that doesn’t suck.\n\n🧪 Want to be part of something chaotic, cool, and code-driven?  \nJoin the org. Fork us. Break things. Build weirdness.\n\nLet the controlled chaos begin.  \n— AtomixCore Team 🧠🔥",

Virtually no learning curve.\n* Consistent and familiar syntax\n* Near-instant conversion to Go\n* Easy install with a singular self-contained executable\n* Beautiful syntax highlighting on Visual Studio Code\n\n# Sample\n\n    package main\n    \n    // Seamless interop with the entire golang ecosystem\n    import \"fmt\" as fmt\n    import \"os\" as os\n    import \"strings\" as strings\n    import \"strconv\" as strconv\n    \n    \n    // Explicit export keyword\n    export fun ([]String, Error) getTrimmedFileLines(String fileName) {\n      // try-with syntax replaces verbose `err != nil` error handling\n      let fileContent, err = try os.readFile(fileName) with (null, err)\n      \n      // Type conversion\n      let fileContentStrVersion = (String)(fileContent) \n    \n      let trimmedLines = \n        // Pipes feed output of last function into next one\n        fileContentStrVersion\n        => strings.trimSpace(_)\n        => strings.split(_, \"\\n\")\n    \n      // `nil` is equal to `null` in Gauntlet\n      return (trimmedLines, null)\n        \n    }\n    \n    \n    fun Unit main() {\n      // No 'unused variable' errors\n      let a = 1 \n    \n      // force-with syntax will panic if err != nil\n      let lines, err = force getTrimmedFileLines(\"example.txt\") with err\n      \n      // Ternary operator\n      let properWord = @String len(lines) > 1 ? \"lines\" : \"line\"\n    \n      let stringLength = lines => len(_) => strconv.itoa(_)\n    \n      fmt.println(\"There are \" + stringLength + \" \" + properWord + \".\")\n      fmt.println(\"Here they are:\")\n    \n      // Simplified for-loops\n      for let i, line in lines {\n        fmt.println(\"Line \" + strconv.itoa(i + 1) + \" is:\")\n        fmt.println(line)\n      }\n    \n    }\n\n# Links\n\n**Documentation:** [here](https://gauntletlang.gitbook.io/docs)\n\n**GitHub:** [here](https://github.com/gauntlet-lang/gauntlet)\n\n**VSCode extension:** [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GauntletProgrammingLanguage.gauntlet-language)",

And yes, this works as a proxy, GitHub remains the source of truth.\n\nI built TurboLFS because my designers were waiting 10–15 hours for Git clones to finish. We have a 20 GB repo with 30,000+ LFS-tracked files — totally normal for game development, but Git LFS couldn’t handle it efficiently.\n\nWhen I switched to self-hosted CI runners, things got even worse. I realized the problem wasn’t going away — so I started building a fix.\n\nI decided to make it an open-source project and build it in public.

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, we introduced an automatic sponsorship system that I think is pretty interesting. We automatically use AI to analyze the impact of each contributor's contributions to our project, then at the end of the month use the AI analysis to come up with a score and do a bulk sponsorship on Github for those contributors. For transparency, we write all the AI analysis to markdown files nightly and compute a tentative CSV with the sponsorship values. Last month we sponsored about $1,677 across 9 maintainers.\n\nThe tracker is completely open-source and maintained by contributors, here's an example of one week's contribution analysis [https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker/blob/main/contribution-overviews/2025-05-21.md](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker/blob/main/contribution-overviews/2025-05-21.md)\n\nThe actual project is tscircuit (a React framework for building electronics) but we've been spending more and more time on our contribution tracking because it's so fun. I have noticed some downsides though- in particular it is fairly easy to game the AI by writing in the description that your pull request has major impact. Contributors tend to not want to fix these issues because they benefit from the generous grading. We also have a lot of technically valid but somewhat low-impact contributions e.g. adding github workflows for format checking etc.\n\nWe tried bounties in the past but I like sponsorships more because there's more ownership/freedom for contributors within the project and a lot less work doing project management from our small 2 person staff.\n\nWe're going to continue extending the system because we think it's a reasonable alternative to hiring full time engineers and allows people to engage with tscircuit in small but important ways",

    "selftext": "💾 [https://github.com/iagoFG/PipePS](https://github.com/iagoFG/PipePS)\n\n✒️ Hope it helps! Some time ago, 🧜‍♀️ like eons, developed this mixer-template processor with extension modules support. We packaged it as a monofile STB library with no dependencies and released under MPL-2.0: it's multi-site, multi-lingual, multi-format, has advanced features like throttle, I/O virtualization, it's own data driver allowing response times under 0,05s when using the integrated data driver and is quite flexible; we developed tons of sites with it, like blogs, newsletters and app backends. Probably the tougher handicap is sections cannot be managed from UI editors so needs to deploy at least empty files, so thisone afaik quite easy, it remains a developer aid tool not a final user one. Also for the moment we didn't included the pump engine with allows to run async tasks both on backend and in frontend. We preferred splitting it into a separate project to maintain things simple. Includes conditional polyfills which makes it compatible with almost any PHP version from the latests and to the oldests.\n\nOn the other hand because can process virtually any data format (not only HTML) it can work both as a traditional multilingual-multisite CMS or as a headless CMS API for your app or reactive webapp; and because includes data virtualization and is compatible with remote fetch you can integrate it with other CMS, datasources or instances so it can work on distributed setups including cloud hubs.\n\nFinally we included basic documentation for a basic site example deployment for the moment, but if you check the code you will quickly see that possibilities are far beyond! Hope that you like it!",

The core it's quite simple, no tons of deps, it's an STB library; most functions are auto-encapsulated utilities or lifecycle start/shutdown/... and only uses a very limited set of global variables mostly for configuration (semi-constants). I used all these elements you mention on Java projects, feels more natural there for the type of projects that usually are. There are good practices for each paradigm. For PHP all this you mention feels like going far and far from it's sweet spot, the reason it was created... and sometimes like this one getting far of your existence reason is probably the reason why PHP is slowly dying lately.",

All free.\n\nThe whole thing is open-source (https://github.com/slax-lab), and we're working on Docker/Linux versions and other self-hosted options because I know how much many of us value having full control over our own data.\n\nBeyond just being a read-it-later app, we've also been building in some AI tools – think auto-generated summaries of articles, or asking an AI questions about what you're reading without leaving the page.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently built a small CLI utility called **cinit** to help speed up the process of starting new C or C++ projects, and I thought some of you might find it useful.\n\n# What is cinit?\n\nIt's a lightweight command-line tool that helps you quickly initialize a new C or C++ project either in the current directory or in a brand new one.\n\nIt's especially useful if you're tired of setting up the same `main.c` / `main.cpp`, Makefile, and folder structure every time.\n\n# Features\n\n* Minimal, zero-dependency setup\n* Supports both C and C++ (C is the default)\n* Simple, intuitive command syntax\n* Helpful options like `--cpp`, `--debug`, `--silent`, and more\n* Works on Linux and Windows (with manual path setup)\n\n# Example Usage\n\nInitialize a C project in the current directory:\n\n    cinit init my_project\n\nCreate a new C++ project in its own directory:\n\n    cinit create my_project --cpp\n\n# Installation\n\n    git clone https://github.com/SzAkos04/cinit\n    cd cinit\n    sudo make install\n\nWindows users can build and add the binary to their PATH manually.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/SzAkos04/cinit](https://github.com/SzAkos04/cinit)",

Last year, I visited our company’s HQ in the US and had a chat with a senior dev who really changed how I think about dependencies, maintainability, and JavaScript frameworks.\n\nIs it also a problem for you when you spin up a landing page and suddenly need to install a bunch of things—just to test an idea?  \nWhat’s your biggest headache with UI libraries right now? How do you deal with it?\n\nI’m working on a **simple, lightweight UI library** made for quickly setting up landing pages to test ideas.  \nIf that sounds interesting, feel free to leave a star on GitHub.

    "title": "Introducing DICI – A Fast and Efficient Lossless Image Compression Format",
    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nNearly a year ago, we open-sourced **DICI** (*Dictionary Index for Compressed Image*). Since then, the project has remained relatively quiet, but today, we are excited to introduce it to the community !\n\n# 📸 What is DICI?\n\nDICI is a lossless image compression format designed to combine efficiency, speed, and quality. In today’s image compression landscape, many formats require trade-offs between quality, file size, and processing speed. DICI stands out by providing a solution that doesn’t force you to choose between these factors. It delivers efficient lossless compression with fast encoding and decoding speeds, all while producing file sizes comparable to or even smaller than those of popular formats like WebP and PNG.\n\n# Supported Formats\n\n* 24-bit RGB\n* 32-bit RGBA\n* 48-bit RGB\n* 8-bit grayscale\n\n# 🚀 Performance Benchmarks\n\nPerformance tests were conducted using the [MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset](https://data.csail.mit.edu/graphics/fivek), which contains 5,000 photographs. The first 3,000 images were extracted and converted to 24-bit BMP format. Conversions to PNG and WebP were performed using a benchmarking tool based on OpenCV, with default settings and multithreading enabled (if available). Tests were conducted on a Ryzen 7 3800XT (8 cores - 3.9 GHz), 16GB DDR4 3200 MHz, Samsung 980 SSD.\n\nThe benchmark results show compression comparable to or better than WebP, with significantly faster encoding and decoding speeds for DICI. Additionally, DICI’s efficiency improves with image size, making it particularly effective for large images (4K, 8K+, ...).\n\n🔗 [Benchmark Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oLSE99_0oJzJbufkOxKr5TmmTNkSFzWYMvTQCkUXeHY)\n\nThe algorithm was also tested on lower-end configurations to confirm that it remains faster than WebP while offering compression that is just as effective, if not better.\n\n# 🤝 Availability & Contributions\n\nDICI is open source and available on GitHub. We encourage the community to explore, test, and contribute to its development. For more details, installation guides, and usage examples, please visit the official GitHub repository.\n\n🔗 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Bralekor/DICI)\n\nIf you’re looking for an image compression solution that combines speed, efficiency, and flexibility, DICI is the answer to your needs.\n\nThank you for your attention and support !",

        "body": "Nitpicks about the code:\n\n* You are hardcoding user-specific paths in your CMakeLists, and use prebuilt binaries not shipped nor mentioned (the LZMA lib). Never do this, as your code is otherwise unbuildable.\n* Please test building with a real compiler like GCC or clang, as MSVC is extremely lax with standards and MS' headers feature huge amount of pollution. You're missing a bunch of `<cstdint>`, `<cmath>` and `<cstring>` imports.\n* Your code does not build on any system with case sensitive paths.\n\nAs for the benchmarks, your numbers mean nothing as there's way too little information about the test setup.\n\n* Are the numbers single runs? An average? If yes, where's the run count and standard deviation? What tool was used to collect the runs? Was this done cold (new executable run each time) or hot (in-process loop)?\n* You mention using the WebP and PNG en/decoding features of OpenCV, however:\n  * The actual APIs used to perform this depend on the target and options OpenCV was built for. On macOS it can use the system built-in APIs, and on Linux it typically uses the system libs as well, but not on Windows. Versions of those affect results.\n  * Their parameters are nowhere to be seen, and defaults have changed in the past, so you have to include every knob that can be turned in the testing data.\n* You are comparing encodes & decodes of your image codec with multi-threading enabled to what is likely single-threaded operations in OpenCV; there's no way a single-thread chunked LZMA encode of a filtered image (your codec) outperforms the Zlib or DCT transforms of PNG and WebP respectively. Keep in mind image codecs are often used in context where multi-threading can be expensive as there's other things going on, like parsing the rest of a webpage's content for example (other cores are busy).\n\nTo top it off, your codec does not specify what color space it operates on. I assume it's sRGB, but these types of details need to be mentioned.\n\nYour efforts are commendable but the methodology is lacking.",

This was my experience with projects like my [HomeLLM ](https://github.com/g1ibby/homellm)setup.\n* **Complex CI/CD Systems:** Great for large applications, but often too much setup for smaller projects.\n\nI wanted something that combined the ease of a simple command with the control and cost-effectiveness of using my own server.\n\nDCD is a CLI tool that tries to bridge this gap.

I've found it helpful for my own workflow.\n\nThe project is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/g1ibby/dcd ](https://github.com/g1ibby/dcd).

It’s a new system (think: logic, AI, and multidimensional context analysis) that’s structurally different from what’s out there.  \nThe problem is: So far, there’s no working prototype. I only have preliminary concepts, some simulations, and a lot of research notes—but nothing you can “use” yet.\n\nHonestly, this uncertainty is tough. Part of me wonders:\n\n* Am I deluding myself?\n* Is it worth pushing forward without a working demo?\n* How do others handle the tension between conviction and self-doubt—especially when there’s nothing to show (yet)?\n\nI’m curious how others here managed similar phases.  \nDid you go public early, or wait until you had something tangible? Did feedback from others help you refine (or redirect) your vision, or did you find that too much outside opinion made it harder?\n\nI’d appreciate any advice, war stories, or just some encouragement. If anyone’s interested in the concepts, I’m happy to share more about the idea and what I’m aiming for.\n\nThanks for reading—and for being a space where it feels safe to ask!",

Primarily because its shaped by the needs of the users that engaged with the project.\n\nUnless you are doing stuff that is 10+ years ahead of time, my suggestion is to build, ship, get users, feedback and decide the next set of features based on real world signals.

    "selftext": "Hi, I'm a Deep Learning Engineer at Refact.ai, and **I wanted to share how we built the #1 open-source AI Agent on SWE-bench Verified, scored 70.4%**. You can check the full leaderboard at [the SWE bench website](https://www.swebench.com). \n\nOur SWE-bench pipeline is open-source and reproducible, check it on GitHub: [https://github.com/smallcloudai/refact-bench](https://github.com/smallcloudai/refact-bench)\n\nKey elements:\n\n* Automated guardrails (messages sent as if from a simulated 'user') to course-correct the model mid-run\n* Claude 3.7 as an orchestrator\n* debug\\_script() sub-agent using pdb\n* strategic\\_planning() tool powered by o3\n* One-shot runs — one clean solution per task.\n\nRunning SWE-bench Lite beforehand helped a lot as it exposed a few weak spots early (such are overly complex agentic prompt and tool logic, tools too intolerant of model uncertainty, some flaky AST handling, and more). We fixed all that ahead of the Verified run, and it made a difference.\n\nI wrote a post sharing shared the full breakdown (and some thoughts on how benchmarks like SWE-bench can map to real-world dev workflows). It also contains our prompt, sub-agent report example, and more details on tools: [https://refact.ai/blog/2025/open-source-sota-on-swe-bench-verified-refact-ai/](https://refact.ai/blog/2025/open-source-sota-on-swe-bench-verified-refact-ai/)\n\n I'm open to your questions!",

    "title": "Kublade - The simple templating engine for Kubernetes deployments",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, just recently I've stepped foot into the open-source community and I wanted to take the chance to share a project of mine. \n\nMeet [Kublade](https://kublade.org), an open-source web platform, build on top of Laravel, that allows for a graphical abstraction and simplification of complex application stack deployments to modern cloud environments. \n\n**What can you expect from Kublade?**\n\n* A simple yet intelligent, web-based template editor with auto-completion support for any type of YAML manifest as well as any other filetype\n* Full Blade-Syntax support in all template files\n* GitOps workflow support for compatibility with tools like FluxCD and ArgoCD\n* An easy, web-shop like configurator for creating new applications in any cluster with just a few clicks\n* Extended multi-cluster support incl. continuous montoring\n\nThat's just the beginning. The full feature set is listed on the [Kublade Homepage](https://kublade.org) alongside with an extensive [documentation](https://kublade.org/docs/intro) and [API reference](https://kublade.org/api/). Feel free to check that out to get a better feeling about what Kublade can offer to the open-source community, and have fun exploring it.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nTo give this post a little bit more meaning than just the promotional part, I wanted to take a second to also dive into why this project even came to be. Maybe, for some of you, this is interesting to read and gives you a little more background information. \n\nI have to admit, I'm not the youngest of people on the internet anymore (who would have imagined...). More or less pushing 30 by now. Be it how it is. Having been in and out of different IT departments and even companies throughout the years gave me the opportunity to discover the uncertainties and widely spread knowledge gaps when it came to modern cloud solutions. Even if there was sufficient knowledge, then time became a limiting factor in most cases, leaving DevOps teams overworked and web- or application developers frustrated. Sadly, to this day, this situation seems to hold on strong. That's the main reason and my intrinsic motivation which brought me to building Kublade. At the end of the day, the ongoing relevance of the cloud makes such topics very interesting to explore.\n\n**If I could wish for something...**\n\nThen I'd wish for feedback, for collaboration, for many chats with interesting people who feel the same or even a different way to spark a lively discussion. If I could wish for something, then I'd wish for this to become a project of the collective that simplifies the lives of people. Tbh. I'd be happy if it even helped one single person in the end. It might not be perfect right now and still show some kind of research character here and there, but I'm sure that it can become something awesome over time.\n\nOn that note, I'd like to end this post and hand it over to you as a community. Looking forward to talking with you!",

Details: There are some programs which I use where the copied material might be a bit sensitive, and for privacy reasons, would like it to get deleted easily - ideally auto-delete after a specified amount of time. I am on Windows 10\n\nI have tired looking for this but found none. If someone can suggest a program, it would be great.\n\nIt also seems [CopyQ ](https://github.com/hluk/CopyQ)is the default popular choice for many. It has scripts, but I am NOT a techie, so don't know how to handle that (with a *lot* of reading and some hit and trial, was able to make *some basic* autohotkey scripts)  \nIf it is not available by default, can someone please help with making a CopyQ script for the purpose?  \n([link to CopyQ documentation](https://copyq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/scripting.html))\n\nThanks in advance, folks :)",

    "selftext": "What is ZeroInput?  \n  \nI've been working on ZeroInput: a Windows AI assistant that learns your workflow patterns and suggests helpful actions in realtime. Think of it as a personal productivity AI that actually respects your privacy by keeping everything local.  \n  \nKey Features:  \n Neural network that learns your app usage patterns  \n 100% local processing no data ever leaves your machine  \n Context aware suggestions based on what you're currently doing  \n Hotkey execution (Alt+Y) to instantly act on suggestions  \n Multilayered AI: ML models + local LLM (Ollama) + rulebased inference  \n Pattern recognition for workflow prediction  \n  \n How It Works\n\n1. Monitors your context: Active windows, recent files, running processes  \n2. Learns patterns: Neural network identifies your workflow sequences  \n3. Generates suggestions: Uses trained models + local LLM for personalized tips  \n4. Adapts over time: Feedback loop improves suggestions based on what you accept/ignore  \n  \nCurrent Architecture  \n📁 ZeroInput/  \n├── 🐍 [main.py](http://main.py)Entry point  \n├── 🧠 agent/  \n│   ├── context\\_tracker.py         System monitoring  \n│   ├── suggestion\\_engine.py       AI suggestion generation  \n│   ├── [integration.py](http://integration.py)Main orchestration  \n│   └── ml/  \n│       ├── ml\\_model.py            LSTM neural network  \n│       ├── ml\\_predictor.py        Inference engine  \n│       └── models/                Trained models  \n├── 🎨 ui/  \n│   ├── [tray.py](http://tray.py)System tray integration  \n│   └── [notifier.py](http://notifier.py)Toast notifications  \n└── 📊 Data files (JSON for memory, patterns, feedback)  \n  \nWhat I'm Looking For  \n  \nI want to take this from \"cool personal project\" to \"genuinely useful tool that people love.\" Here's where I could use your expertise:  \n  \n 🚀 Performance & Scalability  \n Currently using JSON files for data storage  should I migrate to SQLite?  \n The main loop runs every 10 seconds  any suggestions for optimization?  \n Memory management for long term usage?  \n  \n 🧠 AI/ML Improvements  \n Using LSTM for sequence prediction  would transformers be overkill?  \n How to better combine multiple AI approaches (ML + LLM + rules)?  \n Ideas for more sophisticated context understanding?  \n  \n 🎯 User Experience  \n What would make this genuinely useful for YOUR workflow?  \n How intrusive is too intrusive for productivity suggestions?  \n Missing features that would make this a daily driver?  \n  \n 🔧 Technical Architecture  \n Current tech stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Ollama, Windows APIs  \n Considering: async/await refactor, plugin system, web dashboard  \n Any red flags in the architecture?  \n  \n Example Suggestions It Makes  \n  \n \"You often open YouTube after VS Code. Would you like to open it now?\"  \n \"Try using Ctrl+Shift+P to open Command Palette for quick access to VS Code commands.\"  \n \"Consider using Gmail's search operators like 'from:' or 'has:attachment' for more powerful search.\"  \n \"You typically spend 47 minutes in Chrome. Consider setting a timer for breaks.\"  \n  \n Questions for the Community  \n  \n1. Privacy vs. Features: How far should localonly AI go? What features would you sacrifice for privacy?  \n  \n2. Suggestion Quality: What makes an AI suggestion genuinely helpful vs. annoying?  \n  \n3. Integration Ideas: What apps/services would you want this to integrate with?  \n  \n4. Business Model: Would you pay for a tool like this? What price point makes sense?  \n  \n5. Open Source: Should I opensource this? Pros/cons?  \n  \n Technical Challenges I'm Facing  \n  \n Cold start problem: New users get generic suggestions until patterns emerge  \n Context understanding: Distinguishing between work and personal usage  \n Crossapplication workflows: Tracking complex multiapp workflows  \n Performance balance: Rich AI features vs. lightweight system impact\n\nDemo & Code  \n  \nI can share more details, specific code snippets, or even a demo if there's interest.

(i need that to automatically create the virtual environment, source it and download PyQt6 library in, then it launches the UI) is that a proper way to use a piece of software in your opinion or should i change it?",

Having said that, it's highly unlikely that he would come after you, especially if you make it clear that your project is distinct from his. To be safe, you might want to call it UIforKonsave instead of KonsaveUI.\n\nI'm unsure about your second question. Are you asking this as a technical matter or as a licensing matter?",

I've been using Notion and it has a pretty nice UI but would love to go more in-depth for customizing it, for instance format cells, something like Milanotes boards do but more user based and locally stored for preservation (I love Milanotes approach of boards)\n\nSorry if this post is recurrent and tedious to answer but I have not found the perfect piece, and maybe in a couple of months I could give a try to build my personal one ;) Thanks in advance!\n\nPS: Sorry for title typo I'm tired haha",

    "selftext": "I’ve recently started learning **Spring Boot** and built a small website using **REST APIs** to get hands-on with backend development. While digging deeper and watching some YouTube videos, I came across **gRPC**—and I have to say, it really caught my attention. Learning that companies like **Netflix** use it for microservices communication made me want to explore it even more.\n\nThat curiosity opened up a whole new door, and now I’m also getting interested in **GraphQL** and other modern ways of building APIs. I’m realizing that there's no “one size fits all” in API design, and I’d love to understand how all these technologies work together in a real-world setup.\n\nSo I’m thinking of building a project that has **multiple microservices**, each using different protocols like REST, gRPC, and GraphQL—just to get a practical feel of when and why each is used. I’d love to simulate a real-world architecture, maybe even throw in some service discovery, API gateways, and containerization down the line.\n\nIf any of you have built something similar or have experience mixing these technologies, I’d really love to hear about it. What worked for you? What challenges did you run into? How did you handle communication between services or manage the different API styles?",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am sharing my first MCP server, based on my Open Source cybersecurity tool, Cyberbro.\n\nDisclaimer: people told me a lot to add AI directly into my tool and I didn't want that.\n\nThen I discovered MCP based on Cybersecurity researcher I follow (Thomas Roccia) and it changed my mind. \n\nMCP is a standard that allows applications to provide context and functionality to LLMs in a standardized way, similar to a web API, but designed for LLM integrations.\n\nCyberbro is an open-source tool I built for cybersecurity analysts. It takes messy text (like logs, emails, alerts), extracts potential indicators of compromise (IP addresses, URLs, hashes, etc.), and queries multiple reputation sources (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, IPinfo, etc.) to check if they are malicious.\n\nNow with mcp-cyberbro, you can plug it into any MCP-compatible AI system and:\n\n- Trigger observables analysis\n- Check if the analysis is complete\n- Retrieve structured results\n- List available reputation engines\n- Get URL of the analysis \n\nThis makes it easier to build reports related to cybersecurity alerts / malicious IP, domains...\n\nIt is useful in OSINT or just infrastructure investigation, directly from your LLM.\n\nAn example: you use Claude Desktop:\n\n\"Create a OSINT report based on Cyberbro data for the domain example[.]com\n\n<add your report specifications>\n\nPivot and use a maximum of 5 Cyberbro analysis\"\n\nThen it starts to query Cyberbro and writes the analysis.\n\nI tried with other models as well and explained how to plug it with Open Web UI. \n\nMain repo: https://github.com/stanfrbd/cyberbro/\n\nMCP interface: https://github.com/stanfrbd/mcp-cyberbro/\n\nDocs: https://docs.cyberbro.net/\n\nIt’s still evolving, but happy to share and improve it based on your feedback!",

This is literally a DDoS on the entire internet.\n\n>A similar number is given by the Read the Docs project. In a blogpost called, \"AI crawlers need to be more respectful\", they claim that blocking *all* AI crawlers immediately decreased their traffic by 75%, going from 800GB/day to 200GB/day. This made the project save up around $1500 a month.\n\n>I do wonder how much of this is scraping for training data, and how much instead is the \"search\" function that most LLMs provide; nonetheless, according to Schubert, \"normal\" crawlers such as Google's and Bing's only add up to a fraction of a single percentage point, which hints at the fact that other companies are indeed abusing their web powers.\n\nReminds me of what isn't directly stated in the [in depth report MIT Tech Review released recently](https://www.technologyreview.com/supertopic/ai-energy-package/), but is more directly stated in an article on the same topic from over a decade ago I found after 'reading between the lines' of their report and having unanswered questions (though my guesses were spot on).\n\nIt's one thing when 'big business' is providing a necessary function and it is given favorable treatment (tax breaks, etc) which literally just spreads the costs out to the entirety of society.\n\nIt's another thing when favorable treatment (tax breaks, etc) is given to businesses doing frivolous things.\n\nIt's an entirely other universe which is borderline - or in my opinion is - criminal when the business is doing frivolous things which are evidentially harmful towards society and at a disproportionate ratio which effects those who can least shoulder the cost the worst. Which is precisely what this does, if you understand and consider all of the factors involved.\n\nAnyway, a few excerpts from the 2012 article, but it is well worth the read despite its age.\n\nAs a final side note, where I live I only got real internet within the last couple years and most people around here - and many other places - are still or were still paying exorbitant costs for low speeds and a data cap. Or in other words, having no access to \"video on demand\" - supposedly a \"god given right\" ...in 2012.\n\nAlso, keep in mind this is all before \"AI\" was the largest consumer.\n\nAnd fwiw I still don't watch much video. Almost entirely text and some audio.\n\n[Power, Pollution and the Internet by James Glanz 22 Sep 2012](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html)",

        "body": ">“It’s staggering for most people, even people in the industry, to understand the numbers, the sheer size of these systems,” said Peter Gross, who helped design hundreds of data centers. “A single data center can take more power than a medium-size town.\n\n>”Energy efficiency varies widely from company to company. But at the request of The Times, the consulting firm McKinsey & Company analyzed energy use by data centers and found that, on average, they were using only 6 percent to 12 percent of the electricity powering their servers to perform computations. The rest was essentially used to keep servers idling and ready in case of a surge in activity that could slow or crash their operations.\n\n>A server is a sort of bulked-up desktop computer, minus a screen and keyboard, that contains chips to process data. The study sampled about 20,000 servers in about 70 large data centers spanning the commercial gamut: drug companies, military contractors, banks, media companies and government agencies.“This is an industry dirty secret, and no one wants to be the first to say mea culpa,” said a senior industry executive who asked not to be identified to protect his company’s reputation. “If we were a manufacturing industry, we’d be out of business straightaway.”\n\n>...\n\n>Some analysts warn that as the amount of data and energy use continue to rise, companies that do not alter their practices could eventually face a shake-up in an industry that has been prone to major upheavals, including the bursting of the first Internet bubble in the late 1990s.\n\n>\n\n>“It’s just not sustainable,” said Mark Bramfitt, a former utility executive who now consults for the power and information technology industries. “They’re going to hit a brick wall.”\n\n>...\n\n>“If you tell somebody they can’t access YouTube or download from Netflix, they’ll tell you it’s a God-given right,” said Bruce Taylor, vice president of the Uptime Institute, a professional organization for companies that use data centers.\n\n>...\n\n>Viridity had been brought on board to conduct basic diagnostic testing. The engineers found that the facility, like dozens of others they had surveyed, was using the majority of its power on servers that were doing little except burning electricity, said Michael Rowan, who was Viridity’s chief technology officer.\n\n>A senior official at the data center already suspected that something was amiss. He had previously conducted his own informal survey, putting red stickers on servers he believed to be “comatose” — the term engineers use for servers that are plugged in and using energy even as their processors are doing little if any computational work.\n\n>“At the end of that process, what we found was our data center had a case of the measles,” said the official, Martin Stephens, during a Web seminar with Mr. Rowan. “There were so many red tags out there it was unbelievable.”\n\n>The Viridity tests backed up Mr. Stephens’s suspicions: in one sample of 333 servers monitored in 2010, more than half were found to be comatose. All told, nearly three-quarters of the servers in the sample were using less than 10 percent of their computational brainpower, on average, to process data.\n\n>The data center’s operator was not some seat-of-the-pants app developer or online gambling company, but LexisNexis, the database giant. And it was hardly unique.\n\n>...\n\n>“You do have to take into account that the explosion of data is what aids and abets this,” said Mr. Taylor of the Uptime Institute. “At a certain point, no one is responsible anymore, because no one, absolutely no one, wants to go in that room and unplug a server.”\n\n>...\n\n>David Cappuccio, a managing vice president and chief of research at Gartner, a technology research firm, said his own recent survey of a large sample of data centers found that typical utilizations ran from 7 percent to 12 percent.\n\n>\n\n>“That’s how we’ve overprovisioned and run data centers for years,” Mr. Cappuccio said. “ ‘Let’s overbuild just in case we need it’ — that level of comfort costs a lot of money. It costs a lot of energy.”\n\n>...\n\n>Of course, data centers must have some backup capacity available at all times and achieving 100 percent utilization is not possible. They must be prepared to handle surges in traffic.\n\n>Mr. Symanski, of the Electric Power Research Institute, said that such low efficiencies made sense only in the obscure logic of the digital infrastructure.\n\n>“You look at it and say, ‘How in the world can you run a business like that,’ ” Mr. Symanski said. The answer is often the same, he said: “They don’t get a bonus for saving on the electric bill. They get a bonus for having the data center available 99.999 percent of the time.”\n\n>...\n\n>“That’s what’s driving that massive growth — the end-user expectation of anything, anytime, anywhere,” said David Cappuccio, a managing vice president and chief of research at Gartner, the technology research firm. “We’re what’s causing the problem.”",

It's a complete OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect server written in Go.\n\nWhat it actually does:\n* Full OAuth 2.0 flows: Authorization Code (with PKCE), Client Credentials, Resource Owner Password\n* User registration, authentication, email verification\n* Token lifecycle management (refresh, revoke, introspect)\n* Dynamic client registration\n* Complete OIDC implementation with discovery and JWKS endpoints\n* Audit logging\n\nIt passes the OpenID Foundation's Basic Certification Plan and Comprehensive Authorization Server Test. Not officially certified yet (working on it), but all the test logs are public in the repo if you want to verify.\n\nAlmost everything’s configurable: Token lifetimes, password policies, SMTP settings, rate limits, HTTPS enforcement, auth throttling. Basically tried to make it so you don't have to fork the code just to change basic behavior.\n\nIt's DEFINITELY not perfect. The core functionality works and is well-tested, but some of the internal code is definitely \"first draft\" quality. There's refactoring to be done, especially around modularity. That's honestly part of why I'm open-sourcing it, I could really use some community feedback and fresh perspectives.\n\nRoadmap:\n* RBAC and proper scope management\n* Admin UI (because config files only go so far)\n* Social login integrations\n* TOTP/2FA support\n* Device and Hybrid flows\n\nIf you're building apps that need auth, hate being locked into proprietary solutions, or just want to mess around with some Go code, check it out. Issues and PRs welcome. I would love to make this thing useful for more people than just me.\n\nYou can find the repo here: https://github.com/vigiloauth/vigilo\n\nTL;DR: Made an OAuth/OIDC server in Go as a senior project and now I’m open-sourcing it. It works, it's tested, but it could use some help.\n",

It's inspired by Raycast (MacOS), but build from the ground up with Windows (and potentially Linux) in mind using Electron, Vite, and Vue 3 (for the nerds out there!)\n\nIt is 100% open source on Github and free to use. It's still on the beta phase right now but I'm working on it very hard to improve it.\n\nIt has many useful sub-applications (such as Music, Notes, and Weather), alongside with a lightning-fast application search and a SDK for developers.\n\nFeel free to check the repository if you have time and clone / fork my project!",

In an effort to contribute back to the community which we have benefited so much from (both inspirationally and functionally), we wanted to publish some of our internal tools for general / public consumption. In that spirit, there's a few things you should be aware of:\n\n* Feedback is welcome, but as this is an internal tool. We cannot guarantee that ideas / feature requests will be addressed. That being said, an effort will be made to address reasonable requests.\n* Security issues will be addressed as quickly as our team is able to get to them, but we are beholden to the company's priorities.\n* The GitHub repository is just a mirror to allow easy access to the source code. The main repository is private and only accessible to staff, and it contains proprietary information which we cannot share publically. I'm sorry if this is inconvenient, but your understanding is appreciated. The \"commits\" in GitHub mirror the public releases.\n* We've tried to provide comprehensive documentation, but we're only human. In some cases, we have used LLM's to bolster our capacity to write clear and concise documentation. If something isn't clear or something seems off, please let us know and we'll try to address it. It benefits us all if there's clarity, since our own developers use the documentation as well.\n* There are (as of writing) 281 tests which are run 3x (once for Chromium based browsers, once for Firefox, and one for Webkit based browsers) before a version is released. If there are cases which we haven't considered, we would be happy to hear about it.\n\n\nThank you, and happy coding.",

    "title": "Skylos- Yes another dead code detector but hear me out",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! 👋\n\nWe've been working on **Skylos**, a Python static analysis tool that helps you find and remove dead code from your projs (again.....). We are trying to build something that actually catches these issues faster and more accurately (although this is debatable because different tools catch things differently). The project was initially written in Rust, and it flopped, there were too many false positives and the speed was just 2 seconds faster than vulture, a close competitor. Now we have completely rewritten the entire codebase in Python. We have also included how we do our benchmarking, so any feedback is welcome. It can be found in the root directory titled [BENCHMARK.md](http://BENCHMARK.md)\n\n# What Skylos Does:\n\n* **Detects unreachable functions and methods**\n* **Finds unused imports** (even aliased ones)\n* **Identifies unused classes**\n* **Spots unused variables**\n* **Detects unused parameters** (just added this!)\n* **Smarter heuristics** to avoid false positives\n\n# Target Audience:\n\n* **Python developers** working on medium to large codebases\n* **Teams** looking to reduce technical debt\n* **Open source maintainers** who want to keep their projects clean\n* **Anyone** tired of manually searching for dead code\n\n# Key Features:\n\n    bash\n    # Basic usage\n    skylos /path/to/your/project\n    \n    # Interactive mode - select what to remove\n    skylos  --interactive /path/to/project\n    \n    # Preview changes without modifying files\n    skylos  --dry-run /path/to/project\n\n# Real Example Output:\n\n    🔍 Python Static Analysis Results\n    ===================================\n    \n    Summary:\n      • Unreachable functions: 12\n      • Unused imports: 7\n      • Unused parameters: 3\n    \n    📦 Unreachable Functions\n    =======================\n     1. calculate_legacy_metrics\n        └─ utils/analytics.py:142\n     2. _internal_helper\n        └─ core/processor.py:78\n\n# Why Another Dead Code Detector?\n\nUnlike other tools, Skylos uses AST analysis to understand your code structure. It's not just pattern matching - it actually tracks references, tries to understand Python's import system, and handles some edge cases like:\n\n* Dynamic imports\n* Attribute access (`getattr`)\n* Magic methods\n\nWe are still working on others\n\n# Performance:\n\n* Faster and more optimized\n* Accurate: AST-based analysis, not regex\n* Safe: Dry-run mode to preview changes\n\n||\n||\n|Tool|Time (s)|Items|TP|FP|FN|Precision|Recall|F1 Score|\n|Skylos (Local Dev)|0.013|34|22|12|7|0.6471|0.7586|0.6984|\n|Vulture (0%)|0.054|32|11|20|18|0.3548|0.3793|0.3667|\n|Vulture (60%)|0.044|32|11|20|18|0.3548|0.3793|0.3667|\n|Flake8|0.371|16|5|7|24|0.4167|0.1724|0.2439|\n|Pylint|0.705|11|0|8|29|0.0000|0.0000|0.0000|\n|Ruff|0.140|16|5|7|24|0.4167|0.1724|0.2439|\n\n    pip install skylos\n\n# Limitations:\n\nBecause we are relatively new, there MAY still be some gaps which we're ironing out. We are currently working on excluding methods that appear ONLY in the tests but are not used during execution. Please stay tuned. We are also aware that there are no perfect benchmarks. We have tried our best to split the tools by types during the benchmarking. Last, Ruff is NOT our competitor. Ruff is looking for entirely different things than us. We will continue working hard to improve on this library.\n\n# Links:\n\n1 -> Main Repo: [https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos](https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos)\n\n2 -> Methodology for benchmarking: [https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos/blob/main/BENCHMARK.md](https://github.com/duriantaco/skylos/blob/main/BENCHMARK.md)\n\n**Would love to hear your feedback!** What features would you like to see next? What did you like/dislike about them? If you liked it please leave us a star, if you didn't like it, feel free to take it out on us here :) Also if you will like to collaborate, please do drop me a message here. Thank you for reading!",

It rivals commercial players like Veeam, Nakivo, and Macrium in terms of functionality-*but man, the UI/UX looks like it’s stuck in 2012*.\n\nThis is an open-source backup platform with everything going for it:\n\n* Free and cross-platform\n* Image-level and file-based backups\n* Web UI for management(though I'd love to see a native Windows application option too)\n* Works with Windows, Linux, Mac, NAS targets, and more\n* Bare metal recovery options\n* Real-time file backup\n\nBut here’s the kicker: if the UI was modernized, this could dominate the backup space-especially for MSPs and advanced home labs sick of bloated, overpriced alternatives.\n\nThe project is on GitHub (https://github.com/uroni) and maintained by Martin Raiber. I bet he’d welcome support or contributors. And if not? Fork it and build the sleekest, most intuitive backup platform the world has ever seen.\n\nThere’s already a solid engine under the hood now it just needs a new body.\n\nWho's willing to take up the challenge?  \nDesigners, front-end devs, system admins this is the kind of open-source project that could go global with just a little polish.",

    "title": "I created a purely client-side, browser-based PDF to Markdown library with local AI rewrites",
    "selftext": "I'm excited to share a project I've been working on: **Extract2MD**. It's a client-side JavaScript library that converts PDFs into Markdown, but with a few powerful twists. The biggest feature is that it can use a local large language model (LLM) running entirely in the browser to enhance and reformat the output, so no data ever leaves your machine.\n\n**[Link to GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hashangit/Extract2MD)**\n\n**What makes it different?**\n\nInstead of a one-size-fits-all approach, I've designed it around 5 specific \"scenarios\" depending on your needs:\n\n1.  **Quick Convert Only**: This is for speed. It uses PDF.js to pull out selectable text and quickly convert it to Markdown. Best for simple, text-based PDFs.\n2.  **High Accuracy Convert Only**: For the tough stuff like scanned documents or PDFs with lots of images. This uses Tesseract.js for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text.\n3.  **Quick Convert + LLM**: This takes the fast extraction from scenario 1 and pipes it through a local AI (using WebLLM) to clean up the formatting, fix structural issues, and make the output much cleaner.\n4.  **High Accuracy + LLM**: Same as above, but for OCR output. It uses the AI to enhance the text extracted by Tesseract.js.\n5.  **Combined + LLM (Recommended)**: This is the most comprehensive option. It uses *both* PDF.js and Tesseract.js, then feeds both results to the LLM with a special prompt that tells it how to best combine them. This generally produces the best possible result by leveraging the strengths of both extraction methods.\n\nHere’s a quick look at how simple it is to use:\n\n```javascript\nimport Extract2MDConverter from 'extract2md';\n\n// For the most comprehensive conversion\nconst markdown = await Extract2MDConverter.combinedConvertWithLLM(pdfFile);\n\n// Or if you just need fast, simple conversion\nconst quickMarkdown = await Extract2MDConverter.quickConvertOnly(pdfFile);\n```\n\n**Tech Stack:**\n\n  * **PDF.js** for standard text extraction.\n  * **Tesseract.js** for OCR on images and scanned docs.\n  * **WebLLM** for the client-side AI enhancements, running models like Qwen entirely in the browser.\n\nIt's also highly configurable. You can set custom prompts for the LLM, adjust OCR settings, and even bring your own custom models. It also has full TypeScript support and a detailed progress callback system for UI integration.\n\nFor anyone using an older version, I've kept the legacy API available but wrapped it so migration is smooth.\n\nThe project is open-source under the **MIT License**.\n\nI'd love for you all to check it out, give me some feedback, or even contribute\\! You can find any issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/hashangit/Extract2MD/issues).\n\nThanks for reading\\!",

Not part of Nextcloud but FOSS options exist all built around OSM. But again GMaps are multiple product in one that only make sense to combine for an ad driven search engine. OSM are great to give you directions help you find a place.

So you tell it `https://192.168.x.y/collabora/` in the Administration settings. Collabora also needs to know where NextCloud is and I have `https://192.168.x.y/nc/` in its docker-compose.yml. BUT when I go to try and open a document it tries to hit `https://192.168.x.y/browser/` instead of `https://192.168.x.y/collabora/browser`. If I try to use the port instead it will ignore the port and hit `https://192.168.x.y/browser` instead of `https://192.168.x.y:9980`.\n\nSo there's nothing wrong with my configuration. It's a bug.\n\nOther services like Gitlab have the same issue. When you stand up a Gitlab Runner you pass it the host URL along with the token so it should know where it is. `https://192.168.x.y/gitlab/`. However, when the runner tries to clone it hits `https://192.168.x.y/username/your-project.git` instead of `https://192.168.x.y/gitlab/username/your-project.git` like it's supposed to. To their credit they did have an override in Gitlab Runner to fix the clone URL specifically.\n\nBut all this to say....What the hell?

    "selftext": "I am exploring licenses at the moment and curious what are the available licenses if what i want is basically:\n\n1. Anyone can use that software, commercially or not, regardless of the environment in which it is used.\n2. Any changes and improvements done to the source code must be shared even if not distributed to users.\n\nFrom my understanding, GPLv2 checks #1, but not #2 because the source code only must be shared to anyone who runs the software on their own machine, so basically someone can still copy the code, run it on a backend that faces users, and further develop it without sharing his improvements. Also its no longer being updated (AFAIK) so loopholes cant be patched.\n\nanother license I would like to find will also, addionally, have this third requirement:\n\n3. The code can be used alongside proprietary software. As in, if its a library, a proprietary program can use it, but still force to share improvements to the library itself. If its a program that loads plugins, proprietary plugins can be written. It can communicate with a proprietary software on a different process. You get the idea. \n\nThe purpose of #3 is to allow practical usage for more for-profit companies while still requiring them to share direct improvements.\n\nAnd 2 bonus points that could be nice for either license are:\n\n4. compatability with as many other open source licenses as possible.\n\n5. Restricting the ability of AIs to be trained on the project's source code in some way. Perhaps treating AI training as a regular software using the source code and so the AI model must be shared as it is in a way a change of the source code. *I dont care how impossible it is to actually enforce it as long as it makes it illegal to do so.",

You can't explicilty forbid training though, because that would violate two of the four freedoms that define free software (the freedom to use the code however you want to and the freedom to study it).",

Unless CLAs are involved, the maintainer too becomes a licensee of the contributors, and would be required to send changes back to them.

What kind of mathematical transformations are permitted? Can I extract the number of characters in your application's source code and incorporate it as a constant in my proprietary app? What about a vector containing the frequency of certain keywords? Am I allowed to do matrix operation on it?

Each exam allows you to save a separate set of topics and questions into the persistent memory for future re-use / review.\n\nGenerating preparation questions has never been easier.\n\nSelect the exam -> Specify the number of questions -> (Optionally) specify a topic to focus on -> Generate questions.\n\nMoreover, you can also save the topic for future re-use and save the questions you struggled with to a saved questions bank for future review!\n\nAnd the best thing - you only need to create a free Google Gemini token to run the application. Yes, all of that is for free !\n\nStudent-bluebook, was developed with the sole purpose in mind - solve the problem of finding practice exams for industry certifications. If you have ever prepared for the exams like CompTIA Security+ you probably know the pain of finding some high-quality prep questions. I am not even talking about \"for free\", this was never the option in the first place.\n\nFeel free to give Bluebook a try by installing it from PyPi: [https://pypi.org/project/student-bluebook/](https://pypi.org/project/student-bluebook/)\n\nAlternatively, you can deploy a pre-configured docker container running the bluebook: [https://hub.docker.com/r/ilyasmut/student-bluebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/ilyasmut/student-bluebook)\n\nFor detailed \"How To\" guide please either visit the Wiki on github ( https://github.com/ilya-smut/blue-book/wiki/How-To-Page ) or the Bluebook's official website: https://student-bluebook.notion.site/ \n\n",

The code for those would still be available, but the user would have to host their own instance to get them and not everyone can do that. So they will pay you instead. If you want, you can use the AGPL license, so that nobody is allowed to use your stuff in a proprietary project, unless they want to pay you extra for that pleasure - this is called dual licensing. GitLab has an Open Source version that's available for free, but the commercial version is proprietary. I don't think you have to be like GitLab, though. I think your whole app can be Open Source.\n\nIf it's a desktop or mobile app, you can simply sell the binaries in a store like Steam or other stores. If you use the GPL license (you don't have to, but I would recommend it), you have to provide the source code for free, but most people aren't technical enough to compile source code on their own, so of course they will pay you for the build. There are games like that on Steam. There is also Krita, which can actually be downloaded for free from their website (but you don't have to do that) and people still buy the Steam version.\n\nIf it's a library, then you can just do dual licensing like the Qt project does.",

Most of us here on this subreddit probably are only here for the software.\n\n\nI personally did not know what LFX mentorship and GSoC are before now. \n\n\nBecause most of us here are more focused on software. Probably even less has enough hardware experience to be able to mentor or guide you to contribute. So maybe it's time to start something yourself. Or join an engineering club or something.\n\n\nI myself I'm in the Solar Car Club of my university, where we try to compete in some American solar car competitions. For our university, this is a new club, so we have to do a lot of research and build from scratch. Often this means looking at existing designs and attempting to figure out how they work.\n\n\nI initially joined this club to help program any software systems required. But really without hardware there isn't really software... so now I'm working on the electrical team trying to figure out how a buck/boost regulators can be used to regulate the output of a solar array into the input of a lithium ion battery pack and somehow accomodate an AC charger and BLDC motor drive at the same time, possibly running.\n\n\nI would start by analyzing your own expertise and figure out what you need to build real projects and start learning. If you want a guided path, look for projects that you can contribute to and (I think you can) just jump in. I myself raised a few issues on documentation, but I didn't feel like doing them (read: procrastinate), so I decided to try to start my own. For my own project (open source software), I am starting by triaging my knowledge and the project requirements, but still I'm pretty procrastinating more than I should be.\n\n\nBut I wish you good luck.",

It’s built around the open SMIL standard and aims to be self-hostable, scalable, and hardware-agnostic.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n* **Open source** (GPL): Community-driven, transparent.\n* **SMIL-based**: Compatible with most SMIL media players (e.g. IAdea, QBic, [garlic-player](https://garlic-player.com/garlic-player/), and others).\n* **Self-hostable**: Designed for full control over infrastructure and data. (Docker install)\n* **Scalable**: Works for both small setups and larger networks (later).\n* **No vibe coding:** I use AI support, of course, but not to create production code\n* **99 % Test coverage:** but only unit tests currently\n\n**Status:** Alpha – core features are usable, but it’s still early and some rough edges remain.\n\n**Docker images** available (x86 + ARM64):  \n[https://hub.docker.com/r/sagiadinos/garlic-hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sagiadinos/garlic-hub)\n\n**Source + setup instructions:**  \n[https://github.com/sagiadinos/garlic-hub](https://github.com/sagiadinos/garlic-hub)\n\nFeedback, bug reports, and contributions are very welcome.\n\nGreetings Niko",

It’s open source, minimal, and actively being improved.\n\nWould love to hear your feedback, ideas, or criticism. If it’s useful to even a handful of people here, I’ll consider that a win. 🙌\n\nThanks for checking it out.",

They become a monster to set up for your specific use case and then never quite fit. You have to train and force everyone how to use it right and uptake is never on point because it's added work\n\nMy advice, if you have the appetite for it, is to use AI tools to \"vibe code\" your own. Keep it minimal and doing exactly what your team needs. They don't need to be as complex as the big general-purpose ones and there's a huge upside to designing it to put exactly the right information your users need at their fingertips and nothing more. Then you can keep improving it freely as the work evolves and you learn more about what they need",

With ScrollSnap, you just scroll naturally, then click “Save” — it stitches the images together into a single screenshot.\n\n✨ Key Features\n\n* 📜 **Scrolling Capture**: Automatically stitches content into one image.\n* 🖌️ **Customizable Overlay**: Pick the exact area you want to capture.\n* 🖥️ **Multi-Monitor Support**: Works across all your displays.\n* ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal resource usage for quick captures.\n* 🛠️ **Open Source**: Fork it, tweak it, or contribute on GitHub!\n\n📦 Get It Now\n\n* **Download**: [https://github.com/Brkgng/ScrollSnap/releases/tag/1.0.0](https://github.com/Brkgng/ScrollSnap/releases/tag/1.0.0)\n* **Source Code**: [https://github.com/Brkgng/ScrollSnap](https://github.com/Brkgng/ScrollSnap)\n\nIt’s built using **Swift and native macOS APIs**, and designed to be simple and fast. The first version is live, but I’m sure there are bugs and plenty to improve.\n\nIf you’re interested in contributing (or just testing it out), I’d love to hear your thoughts. PRs and issues welcome!\n\nThanks for checking it out 🙌",

    "title": "I built an open-source Decimal ↔ Balanced Ternary converter that can handle 21M+ numbers in the browser",
    "selftext": "Balanced ternary is a lesser-known but fascinating number system where each digit can be -1, 0, or 1. Instead of using -1, the symbol `T` is often used. So, for example, `T10` means:  \n(-1 × 9) + (1 × 3) + (0 × 1) = -6.\n\nIt’s a *balanced* system because the digits are symmetrically distributed around zero. This makes certain computations, comparisons, and even some hardware designs cleaner — and it's an interesting area of research in computer science and mathematics.  \n  \nWhile researching Goldstein's theorem and analyzing number distributions in balanced ternary for research, I needed to convert large datasets between decimal and balanced ternary. But I couldn't find any converters online, let alone something which can convert in bulk\n\nSo... I built one!\n\n🔁 **Decimal ↔ Balanced Ternary Converter**  \n🔗 Live demo: [https://vbprodev.github.io/decimal-and-balanced-ternary-converter/](https://vbprodev.github.io/decimal-and-balanced-ternary-converter/)  \n📦 Source: [https://github.com/vbprodev/decimal-and-balanced-ternary-converter](https://github.com/vbprodev/decimal-and-balanced-ternary-converter)\n\n# ⚙️ Key Features:\n\n* Convert single numbers or **bulk ranges** (e.g., `1,1000` or `T0,1T1`)\n* Handles **21 million+ entries** using Web Workers — the UI stays smooth\n* Output to clipboard for small sets, or `.txt` file download for large ones\n* Fully responsive and accessible interface\n\nBuilt with:\n\n* HTML, SCSS, TypeScript\n* Web Workers for async processing\n* No backend — everything runs **entirely in your browser**\n\nThe aim is let you convert non standard number systems (like this one) into standard one's like base 10, base 8, or base 16",

I coded along with a YouTube video and also copied parts of the code from a GitHub repository shared by the tutorial creator (published under MIT license).\n\n  \nAfter completing the tutorial, I started modifying the project on my own, adding new features and changing some of the original logic. So, i ended up having a new application pretty different from the original reference.\n\nNow, i'd like to publish this project and showcase it in my portfolio (i'm not planning on selling it or anything like that) and i understand that I still need to include the original MIT license from the tutorial creator, but my question is: \n\nCan I also include my own copyright notice alongside it?  \nIs that allowed, or considered good practice?\n\nI was thinking of doing something like this:\n\n    MIT License\n    \n    Copyright (c) [YEAR] [ORIGINAL_DEV_NAME]\n    Copyright (c) 2025 [MY_NAME]\n    \n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction.......",

    "selftext": "I'm developing an open-source macOS application (using Dioxus, if that matters) for the first time, and I'm running into the common distribution hurdle related to Apple's signing and notarization requirements.\n\nMy goal is to self-distribute my app (e.g., via GitHub Releases) without paying the hefty membership fee, considering I'm just starting. I understand this comes with limitations, and I'm trying to figure out the best practices that other open-source projects adopt.\n\nCurrently, when I bundle my app (using `dx bundle --platform macos`), I get a `.dmg` file. However, users downloading it (or even me, after uploading to GitHub and redownloading) frequently encounter the \"App is damaged and cannot be opened. You should move it to the Trash.\" error.\n\nI know the `xattr -cr /path/to/YourApp.app` command can bypass this for the user, but that's a pretty technical step to ask every casual user to perform.\n\nSo, I'm genuinely curious:\n\n1. **What's the standard approach for open-source macOS projects to publish MacOS apps?**\n2. **Are there any other tools or methods you use to prepare your** `.dmg` **or** `.app` **that might make Gatekeeper less aggressive without full notarization?** (e.g., specific `codesign` flags, even if ad-hoc, or `hdiutil` tricks?)\n3. **For those who** ***do*** **pay the fee for an open-source project, what made you decide it was worth it?** Was it purely for user experience, or are there other benefits that justify the cost for an FOSS project?\n\nI'm trying to strike a balance between making it accessible for users and keeping it genuinely free (for me) to develop and distribute. Any insights, workflows, or tips from experienced open-source macOS developers would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!",

But there's one thing I haven't looked at in years: does using a self-signed certificate (that one is free) change the message in any way?\n3. User demand. When Apple introduced Gatekeeper, we got requests from users to sign the app. Main reasons brought forward were convenience and improved security. Nowadays I would add \"combatting Apple's scare tactics\", because in the beginning, the message didn't read \"this app is damaged \\[...\\]\" (which is a lie, plain and simple). This is quite important, because there will be (a large number of) people who see the message and immediately delete your app and never look back.\n\nBut don't let that keep you from getting started. Unsigned apps still exist. Not everybody can or wants to afford the fee. Add to your release on GitHub that the app is unsigned including the xattr command and you're fine.",

    "selftext": "TLDR- any  recommendations for open source equipment management with rental system of some way?\n\nHey guys\n\nI’m working on a simple (hope so) rental system for my college’s camera department. Students can request gear, and managers handle approvals and track the rentals.\n\nEach item has multiple units (like different cameras of the same model), and managers should only be able to approve a request if a unit is available during the requested dates.\n\nHow the equipment is structured: •\tItemType: e.g. “Canon EOS R5” – the general category •\tItemUnit: specific pieces with serial numbers like CAM001, CAM002 Students request an ItemType, and managers assign a specific ItemUnit\n\nExample rental flow:\n\nStudent requests a “Canon EOS R5” from July 1–5 → Manager assigns CAM001 → Status moves from: pending → approved → picked_up → returned → CAM001 becomes available again\n\nA few questions: 1.\tAre there any open-source rental systems I can use or learn from? 2.\tDoes the ItemType/ItemUnit separation sound like a solid approach?\n\nTech stack is Next.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript.\n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.",

        "body": "Are you aware of Chocolatey GUI? The Choco id is chocolateygui.\n\nI have a vision for how updating should work on Windows which is rooted in independence. My issue with the Windows Store, Steam and chocolatey is that they all centralise the meta data that the updater requires forcing everyone through the store even if the files are stored on a variety of servers in the case of chocolatey. This isn't really the historical way of Windows working which is companies and individuals releasing installers separately requiring permission from nobody providing their own store or download page. We need an evolution of that approach for Windows with auto updates.\n\nThe centralised repository us rooted in how linux works and its good for Linux because an open source community owns that repository. Its bad on Windows because a private profit motive is slapped on top mixing store and updater. Indeed chocolatey has itself a profit motive to its operations because it has to store quite a lot of data and yet it can't store all the files but I think they might want to.\n\nThe more Windows way would be for installers of programs to install a common updater and just register with it if it already exists. So lots of programs ship with an installer that has the updater in it that deals only with the updating and this registration points to their own meta data and file storage from their own website, so in effect its more a client program and a standard for data for storing all the installers of the program. The updater then deals with reading that meta data and providing notice of updates or auto updating as the user has setup within their time frame. It could easily provide a rollback feature etc etc, its just for controlling the updates. In many ways it could take over the installation process, you can imagine a user downloads an installer that is for the updater with the URL embedded for the program and then the updater if newly installed then downloads and installs the program.\n\nI think this is an approach where a free and open source software can really compete and meet the Windows approach to software. It could also include and support paid for software as well fairly easily.\n\nIt should sit quietly in the tooltray using maybe 10s of MBs at most. This ought to be what the Windows OS did years ago but it didn't.\n\nDo with the proposal as you wish, I was at one point trying to write this but I got ill with Longcovid and doubt I ever will now but I think its the better fit for how Windows works.",

    "selftext": "Yo!\n\n**The Problem I Was Solving:**\n\nYou have a repository and need to chunk it for training, fine-tuning, or whatever reasons. Most tools are CLI-only, which means:\n\n* Remembering command syntax every time\n* Typing out long file paths\n* No visual way to see what files you're actually processing\n\nPreviously we were also CLI only LOL. But now it has a dashboard.. alas! \n\n**What I Built:**\n\nA professional web interface for code chunking with:\n\n* **Visual file browser** \\- See your entire repo structure, organized by folders\n* **Selective file processing** \\- Check boxes for exactly which files you want\n* **Multiple input methods** \\- Type paths manually OR upload files directly\n* **Chunking strategies** \\- Equal chunks vs max token size, configurable on the fly\n\n**Who This Is For:**\n\n* **Anyone** who's tired of command-line tools for repetitive tasks\n\n**Why Web Interface > CLI:**\n\nHonestly? Because I'm lazy. I was spending more time remembering command arguments than actually processing code. I wrote this library, and yet I have to refer to my own readme for the commands. Now it's:\n\n1. Open browser\n2. Point to repo\n3. Pick what you want\n4. Hit process\n5. Done\n\n**To use it** \n\nInstall the dependencies. Make sure gradio is installed. Then run komodo --dashboard\n\n**The Stack:**\n\nGradio\n\nPlease do try it and let me know your feedback. Also do leave a star if you found it useful, or if you want to contribute, you can drop me a message on reddit :) \n\n[https://github.com/duriantaco/pykomodo](https://github.com/duriantaco/pykomodo)\n\n[https://pykomodo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://pykomodo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n",
