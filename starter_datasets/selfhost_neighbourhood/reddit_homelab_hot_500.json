The foil has the potential to transfer any static charges directly to the products it's wrapped around, as it has no isolation.  In addition, there's no dissipative layers to actually discharge the static.  The static will dissipate but that may be into your expensive chip.\n\nConsider that when you take this conductive layer and rub it against an insulator (which you will get in packing material via bubble wrap, peanuts, etc), it will generate static electricity.  It's creating ideal conditions for static to generate and then discharge into the device during shipping.  Let's say you don't have that insulation though, well then you have the potential for external charges to transfer from outside the box into the product.  What immediately comes into mind is conveyor belts at package sorting centers, which can transfer very large charges.\n\nIf it's me I'm not touching any product packaged like this, instant return.  The damage as a result of static can be extremely subtle and go unnoticed even with extensive testing.  It may not manifest in issues immediately or notable issues.\n\nFoil used to be used in conjunction with plastic foam to provide at least some benefit.  That said you typically want something with more resistance than aluminum / tin foil to dissipate more charge.  Metal out anti-static bags are best for sensitive electronics and even they have a higher resistance.",

I highly recommend that you edit or delete it to prevent this undesirable outcome.\n\nIn the case of a tin foil bag, it is as bad, if not worse than simply not having bagged it at all.  The foil has the potential to transfer any static charges directly to the products it's wrapped around, as it has no isolation.  In addition, there's no dissipative layers to actually discharge the static.  \n\nConsider that when you take this conductive layer and rub it against an insulator (which you will get in packing material via bubble wrap, peanuts, etc), it will generate static electricity.  It's creating ideal conditions for static to generate and then discharge into the device during shipping.\n\nIf it's me I'm not touching any product packaged like this, instant return.

It is ESD safe because it does not generate a charge when handled.\n\nThe metallic looking one (or black/grey if its graphite doped) is static dissipative, this can have either a high resistance or can be a good conductor. Graphite based foam (how some individually packaged ICs are shipped) have a very low resistance (few ohms per cm). \n\nThe goal of the ESD safe/static dissipative bags is to keep its contents on the same potential. Does not matter if its 0V or thousands of kilovolts. Differential charge is what kills, not the charge itself.\n\nAluminum foil is not ideal because it does not make contact with every single pin of the sensitive component (unlike graphite based foam, thus there is a potential for a voltage difference), nor does it completely isolated (like the metallic looking static dissipative bags which have an inner isolating anti-static layer). But its better than nothing, as it is anti-static and have a good chance that it touches enough pins of the component and the component can internally leak enough charge quickly to not develop a voltage potential between its pins.",

I highly recommend that you edit or delete it to prevent this undesirable outcome.\n\nIn the case of a tin foil bag, it is as bad, if not worse than simply not having bagged it at all.  The foil has the potential to transfer any static charges directly to the products it's wrapped around, as it has no isolation.  In addition, there's no dissipative layers to actually discharge the static.  \n\nConsider that when you take this conductive layer and rub it against an insulator (which you will get in packing material via bubble wrap, peanuts, etc), it will generate static electricity.  It's creating ideal conditions for static to generate and then discharge into the device during shipping.\n\nIf it's me I'm not touching any product packaged like this, instant return.  The damage as a result of static can be extremely subtle and go unnoticed even with extensive testing.  It may not manifest in issues immediately or notable issues.",

I'm going to test some software integrations to make a home assistant/AI accessible with ASL, you should be able to hand sign to it, and it should hand sign back....as far as I know the software hasn't been integrated like that...the node will consist of a TV connected to rasberrypi, with  cheap tapo camera, micro phone...on paper it looks like it should work. Long way from a working prototype. \n\nProbably the most important....I have to wire a couple 30amp plugs off my fuse panel. \n\nAs it stands now, I have less than 2k in the whole setup. That includes replacing 2 processors, 15 hard drives, nic card, perc battery replacement, and some misc other parts I've expirimented with.

Meanwhile consumer grade hardware isn't. \n\n  \nFor the guys running a consumer grade stack, did you had any problems along? How long are you running it already? \n\n  \nFor the guys running Enterprised grade hardware: did you have problems? Most of uw will run older hardware as that is something which we can actually pay, instead of new enterprised hardware.. \n\n  \nAre older enterprised hardware more reliable then current consumer grade when running 24/7? \n\n  \nIf you didn't think about power draw & noice, what will your choice be & why? Looking a cluster which i can use long term without to much maitenance myself beside what i am hosting and doing with the machine itself. ",

Ceph still would cause some downtime so running everything parallel and adding redundancy on app-level is my current 'best' idea. Meaning i'd focus on fault-recovery rather than having a fully watertight solution. (In my case that's swapping an sd card and or the odroid, then reboot).",

I started with a \\*SHITTY\\*  [Dell Latitude 3190 school edition](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/2-in-1-laptops-tablets/latitude-3190-education/spd/latitude-11-3190-laptop), that my niece was issued during covid for school that they had allowed her to keep- but was locked. So I removed them from the laptop, and used it for months on end. Now My homelab consists of-\n\nHP ProDesk 400 G3 Mini 256GB SSD, 256 NVME, 16GB RAM- Runs Proxmox as my services (iventoy, pihole, etc) and is used as a testing lab for VM's.\n\nAnother HP ProDesk 400 G3 Mini 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM- Currently running UbuntuServer with UbuntuGnome Desktop UI for funsies, and CasaOS as the actual server part of it. Used as a personal NAS, and a few other services only use and no one in my family accesses.\n\nA Lenovo Thinkcentre m75n 128gb 2230nvme+4TB nvme, 8GB RAM- Runs windows and hosts my syncthing server for my retroarch saves, and my plex server. It's also technically a NAS for my Movies and TV.\n\nMy actual gaming PC running a Ryzen 5 5600X and a RX 6750XT that I'm using to turn into a game server for my family.\n\nI use the above mentioned Dell Latitude 3190 with 4gb RAM and 64GB soldered emmc memory as a controller for the homelab now. Currently it runs windows- but I'm exploring alternative. In alkl honesty, I'll probably end up with Ubuntu24 on it.\n\nThis is just what I was able to scrape together, and obviously it's still growing but thats the best part- you get to grow and have fun and who cares what you have.",

Any kluged or janky solution should *always* be temporary. If I absolutely have to depend on it, I'll pay more for hardware with a better reputation. In general, consumer and prosumer gear is a 3-5 year cycle; also in general, enterprise gear has been known to stay very usable beyond a decade. YMMV, but mine is based on multiple decades of experience in this field. The factors you should be focusing on include power use, cooling demands, noise level (if in human living space), reliability, total ROI, and suitability to the desired solution.

    "selftext": "First build in April vs current state\n\nHi everyone, first time poster just wanting to show off my first homelab. My work had a bunch of old servers that were no longer being used but were still in a 42RU rack since their migration to Azure back in 2021 and I was lucky enough to receive them after we had to move office locations.\n\nI bought the 18RU rack, the UDM Pro and just today received the MD1400. Still waiting on some mini-SAS cables to arrive Everything else came from my work.\n\nHow’d I do? 😅 \n\nI run the main server with Windows Hyper-V as Microsoft is my bread and butter with a mix of Windows and Ubuntu running Docker guests. I am keen to dive into Proxmox at some point, it looks cool. The T330 is running TrueNAS and is mostly just NFS for Plex. Excluding the MD1400, the power draw at idle sits ~280W and temps are good as I live somewhere cold.\n\nAll in all, I’m pretty happy with where it’s at but am always looking to optimize and improve as well as try new apps/find a use for the power these servers are pushing so any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nDell PowerEdge R640 Server\nHyper-V VMs\n2x Intel Xeon Silver 4215 2.5-3.5GHz 8C/16T\n480 DDR4 2400Mhz ECC RAM\n2x 120GB Intel SATA SSD (OS) in RAID 1\n6x 1.2TB Dell 12Gbps 10K SAS (Data) in RAID 10\nWindows Server 2022 Datacenter Edition\n\n2x Dell PowerEdge R630 Servers\n2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 v4 2.2-3.1GHz 10C/20T\n128GB DDR4 2400Mhz ECC RAM\n2x 120GB Intel SATA SSD\n6x 1.2TB Dell 6Gbps 10K SAS\nNo OS (server not in use; one not in rack)\n\nDell PowerVault MD1400\n12x Dell 4TB 6Gbps 7.2k SAS drives\n\nDell PowerEdge T330\nIntel Xeon E3-1240 v6\n64GB DDR4 2400Mhz ECC RAM\n2x 120GB Intel SATA SSD\n6x 4TB WD Red SATA 5.4K HDDs\nTrueNAS Community Edition\n\nI also received a PowerEdge FX2s (not pictured) which I gutted all the RAM, SSDs and CPUs to upgrade the R630s with, the now decommissioned 25x1.8TB SAS Unity 300 as the power draw was waaayyy too much for my liking (400w) as well as sets of Dell EMC N2024, N3048, N4032F N3048P and N1124P-ON switches.",

    "selftext": "So for my homelab I embarked on a search for datacenter SSD's.   \nI imagined 1-2 as a boot OS / fast data storage for my proxmox node and then two more as metadata vdevs for my TrueNAS.\n\nI first ordered a couple from eBay that were supposed to be:  \n\"New: Other (see details): A new, unused item with no signs of wear. The original packaging may be missing, or the original packaging may have been opened or is no longer sealed. A new item with a manufacturing defect or other minor flaws.\" and this is what I got:\n\nssd1 (DC S3500):   \npower\\_on\\_hours: 0  \nwrite commands 404454286   \nread commands 1936299250  \nhardware resets 20683  \ntwo logged errors at 10041h and 16538h\n\nssd2 (DC S3500):  \npower\\_on\\_hours: 0  \nwrite commands 2432701980   \nread commands 10146662   \nhardware resets 18680 \n\nssd3 (DC S3700):  \npower\\_on\\_hours: 32688  \nCRC\\_Error\\_Count: 194820  \nwrite commands: 353331062   \nread commands: 280733479   \nerrors logged at 16764 hours\n\nSo obviously not \"new, unused\" and the first two had their S.M.A.R.T. wiped. \n\nI then went on to check local auction portals and sellers either claim to not know what a S.M.A.R.T. is and at the same time assure me that the drives are perfectly fine, because some software showed them the health is at 100% and others, only provide power\\_on\\_hours and/or TB written. \n\nfor example:   \nDC S3700 - 98345h, 57TB written  \nDC S3520 - 60000h, 98% health  \nDC D3-S4510 - \"used only couple of weeks\"\n\nWhat I guess am trying to ask here is how do you go about finding a good deal? Do you skip the offeer if there is no \"genuine\" data available? Or if the price is very attractive do you take the risk and order, hoping that it won't be that bad?",

Random ebay punk won't have a bunch of SAS drives listed\n* How many of the items are for sale of that type. Nobody is decommissioning a data-center rack(s) shows up on ebay with \"I have 1 for sale - only used a week\". It's gonna be \"25+ for sale and they all have guaranteed 80%+ life\". They're not gonna screenshot the SMART data individually\n* Look at whether they have a VAT number registered\n* No auctions - the more legit sellers tend to just give the price they want in my experience\n* In certain countries a fair bit of info is public. e.g. Last place I bought - I know the guys name & DoB and that his companies are lenovo, dell and microsoft approved and have some ISO certs. It's no guarantee but there is a high chance this guy does actually have access to a good used gear pipeline\n* Run the SSDs in mirror or at least with parity. (or in a use case where you don't care - scratch drive etc)\n\nThat said not a fan of HDDs this way...all it takes is one solid knock while it's spinning and it's fucked. Might not even be intentional just someone not paying attention. 2nd hand enterprise SSDs are a more palatable roll of dice to me.",

In passing. I get to travel all over the country and they pay me to do it. Has absolutely nothing to do with IT (at least; my role). \n\nMostly it gives me a funky schedule that means working and being gone from home for a few days, then being home for a few days. And because of the way my schedule works, it’s not unusual for me to go a week or more without working that isn’t necessarily vacation time (My spouse is still at work, for example). \n\nSo… a job that gives me lots of free time to break stuff and start projects that I might one day finish. Homelab is a great hobby that fits that!",

But during that whole time I reinvigorated my love for building things and designing elegant (and some times stupid) solutions.\n\nNow, this next bit I couldn't have done without the professional relationships I built in my 20's, I was able to showcase my new, different skill set with \\*nix, bash, and perl scripting that I came to my current employer to standup a new B2B web app and integrate it with a myriad of other systems. Now I'm the Linux/systems admin.\n\nCode writing is such an art form for me that I was losing my mind doing it as a job. Little did I know that slugging it out in my earlier years was setting up the pathway to where I am now.  \nWork is still work. There's always bits about it that I need to space out or schedule in such a way that I don't fall into some bit of despair. But my skillset is much better utilized and appreciated in my systems admin role than it was in development. I'm more effective which leads to overall satisfaction and I'm not in a position where my perfectionism leads me into the unofficial role of Team Code Nazi.\n\n  \nI've got no advice at all. Ha, my life decisions history is certainly not stellar.  \nBut I have felt something similar to what you describe.\n\nI've self sabotaged a lot in my life. But I am an example that satisfaction in life can come from a path that isn't always trending up.",

    "selftext": "Hello to all,\n\napologies if my post is ill-placed or lacking (if so do not hesitate to tell me). Technically speaking, I am quite the novice-beginner.\n\nI currently have a 12gb RAM, N100-based, \"turnkey\" Chuwi Larkbox X. On top of it :  \n\\- 2x 3.5\" HDDs plugged through a basic Sabrent, SATA to USD, dual docking station ;  \n\\- 1 Coral USB plugin for detection.\n\nI use it for media (Jellyfin), surveillance (Frigate) and basic HAOS stuff. Maybe some retro gaming but nothing more advanced. \n\nThe setup works well but I can have a few bottleneck situations with Frigate and very high bitrate Jellyfin plays which can lag (especially when both are at work).\n\nTo give myself more headroom, I have been considering a Mini-ITX upgrade, for instance on Jonsbo N2 type of case. I feel the AM5 option to be quite interesting, especially looking at the B650 \"Night Devil\" motherboard which checks many boxes for my use at a great price. \n\n1. Would switching to an AM5 build bring downsides/complications for performance and compatibility? I am thinking for instance of hardware acceleration on Jellyfin and Frigate. Tech skills are not my forte, just wondering how PITA will it be.\n2. What would be a good perf-to-price AM5 CPU with integrated graphics ? Would that be plenty enough for the use above or shall I also buy a discrete GFX ? \n\nThank you for your time.  \n",

If they're mounted via device id, disklabel etc it should be fine.\n\nif you're running Windows, you might be able lucky and it will just boot up but you'll probably have to re-activate which shouldn't be an issue unless it's an OEM edition that came with the existing system",

The 8 pin has 2x 5v pins, 2x 12v pins and 4x GND pins, 1x5v 1x12v and 2x GND go to a PATA Molex, so 2 PATA connect to the same PCIe on the backplane.\n\nIt's a 24 bay case, so each 8 pin Molex on the backplane will be powering 6 drives.\n\nI plan to use a Corsair RM1000x that I have in my main NAS for this build which has 6x 6pin PCIe SATA/Peripheral connectors. Each with 1x 5v, 1x 12v and 2x GND pins each.\n\nI am already 2x 5v, 2x 12v and 4x GND short if I were to do a 1:1 backplane to PSU, although the 12v and GND are less of a concern as I can take these from the 6x 6pin PCIe connectors on the PSU.\n\nI was wondering if I can double stuff the pins on the PSU side of the cable to power the full 6 drives for each connector on the backplane, as I'm planning to add some SSDs and an Adaptec SAS expander powered via Molex and not PCIe slot, so would prefer at least 1 of the 6pin SATA/Peripheral Connectors on the PSU to connect these to.\n\nAlso is double stuffing the pin the best way or would you run a short jumper on the PCIe connector on the backplane to acheive the same?\n\n  \nThanks",

I did the upgrade online, it went through, and my speed went up but not enough, only to about 800/50.  I talked to tech support about it, they tried some debugging on their end and said they would need to send out a tech.\n\nHe came out, ran tests with my modem and his little tester device, went back and forth a bunch.  He ended up lifting the speed cap entirely (1200/200 was the fastest tier they offered anyway), and I was still stuck at 800/50 even though his hand tester was showing more.  The modem was my personal device, not one from the ISP, but it all claimed to be compatible.  He apologized for not being able to fix the issue and recommended I try a different modem just in case.\n\nI did some more research and discovered that, while my modem was compatible, it was only for the lower speed tiers.  Technically the model could handle higher speeds but not with the specific modulation schemes the ISP used on their higher tiers.  I ended up switching my plan to rent an ISP modem instead, it came in, I switched it to bridged mode and hooked it up, and low and behold, I started getting 2500/350.  A couple weeks later I got a message from the ISP apologizing for not being able to resolve my issue and gave me 30% off that month's bill.\n\nI fully expected later on my speed would drop back down to my plan's limits, but I'm sitting here a full year later, still getting 2500/350, AND that 30% off was somehow made permanent, so I've been getting double the advertised speeds AND paying 30% less than I should be for a year now.

There are fewer and fewer addresses that ISPs can allocate to their customers.  \nNAT was a hack that solved this for a while, instead of giving every device a public route-able IP address, private addresses and NAT'ing to a single public IP address was born. \\~Timeskip/a few decades later\\~ we're back at it, we need to preserve addresses. NAT worked the first time, let's double it.\n\nThey just started a thing called carriergrade NAT. Here's a neat picture: [https://www.rapidseedbox.com/wp-content/uploads/CGNAT\\_02.png](https://www.rapidseedbox.com/wp-content/uploads/CGNAT_02.png)  \nIt's basically double-NAT and in my opinion double trouble. Fuck NAT, let's all at least try to implement Dual Stack (IPv6 and IPv4 in parallel), so that we can one day fucking kill IPv4 with all it's ugly hacks.\n\nAnyway. How can that cause problems? There is a specific network range that ISPs should use for CGNAT, but not all ISPs are using it. Some ISPs use other private ranges, I know of at least one near me that is doing this.  \nIf your ISPs is using 10.10.10.X/24 for CGNAT, so your router thinks it has a \"public\" IP like [10.10.10.123](http://10.10.10.123) and if you are using the same network internally.... well, you get connectivity issues. ;-)\n\nThat probably is not the case with your problem, the red light is a good indicator for something else, but it can still be a cause of problems.\n\nCya",

They asked me if I was using an AP or something for Wi-Fi. I I'm using something and they it's my equipment that's not working. So I disconnected my pfsense router and had them check again, they said they sent a reset code to the ONT and it should work now. They have me a report number and hung up. An hour later, still no internet. I called again, they said they will send a tech. Next day the tech arrived, he couldn't get the ONT to work, so he replaced it. He said it would be working in about a half hour. He left. I connected my pfsense to the ONT and waited, it never came on. So I called them again, they said the ONT isn't registered to my account. They said a tech would have to come out to get the MAC address and serial number. I told them I could provide that and said it had to be the tech. So another day, no internet. \n\nThe tech can out again to check, I told him that customer service said the ONT isn't registered, he started to blame my network setup, saying that the pfsense is send an invalid MAC address to the ONT and that's why it won't connect. He wanted to see the settings on the pfsense. I really didn't want to do it, but I thought that because he said that if he doesn't see my setup, he can't help me. So he made a comment about my internal IP address being different from the one the ONT provided via DHCP. So I asked if the ONT can be put in bridge mode so I can use it like a modem only and he said that I wouldn't have internet except for one device and I said that's exactly what I want. \n\nHe said that it won't be able to handle all my devices because it can handle only one connection at a time. I told him that my pfsense router can do the rest and he said no. He said that I don't know what I'm talking about and that my setup wouldn't work. I let him know that is how it's been working for years, just please put it in bridge mode and register it with the company. He called in and said that I have a business type setup and that he can't help me and that I need to set up a business account and have business service. So he left.\n\nI called customer service again and let them know that the tech did nothing except reset pfsense and didn't even bother ask me first. They said that the notes say I have an internet café or some large business with hundreds of connections. I told them thats not true, I have a residence and maybe 30 or so devices, including my smart devices like light switches, streaming devices and Alexa devices in every room. They said that's not normal. I told her that I have a 3 story house and almost 20 smart switches, 8 Alexa devices, 5 Firesticks, 12 Wyze cameras and 4 Reolink PoE cameras with NVR, 3 cell phones, 2 tablets, 2 laptops, a server, a personal computer and that's just us 2, when family comes to visit, well I just don't know how many more devices are connected. She said that's too much for the service I have, I asked her what my service is and she said I have 800d and 400u. So I asked why that isn't enough?\n\nI told her to cancel my service and I'll just go with Mega-Cable and she said but sir you've been with us for 12 years and I exactly, but you guys don't care, so cancel my service. She said what can I do to keep you as a customer and I said you can start with activating my ONT. She said a tech would have to do that, so I said that's OK, just cancel me. She then asked for the MAC and serial number. Got me activated in a couple of minutes.\n\nGood thing I backup my pfsense settings, I have openvpn and other things setup in pfsense. Everything is working now. I don't understand why the techs they use are such ID-10-T síndrome.",

Now I let them go through their holier than thou speech. Politely disagree with them and about the time they begin to double down I break out my ISP ont/router and say \"okay, if what you're saying is true, this will work right?\" You can see them hit the mental brick wall. \n\nIf you face similar issues I cant recommend enough you keep or buy the standard issue equipment. Yes it collects dust but an hour or two each year but it's worth shutting them up.",

At the moment I don't have much that is going to kick out a lot of heat (router, switch, couple IoT hubs, 2018 Mac Mini, etc), but I plan to expand to include NVR, UPS, and a 2-4u server for greater workloads/experimenting with larger LLMs.\n\nThat being said, I think 12-15u would be sufficient for space, but don't know if I should get an enclosed rack or an open rack. It would be inside a spare room in the house, so dust would be minimal and the room has ok AC (not the coldest room in the house but also not the hottest). What are your thoughts?",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nI was hoping to use a Lenovo P510 in my homelab. It has two backplanes that accept 2 3.5\" drives each, either SATA or SAS. Each backplane has a 4-pin power cable (plugged into the motherboard) and a mini-SAS cable, which can either plug into the motherboard SATA ports (using a supplied mini-SAS to SATA adapter) or into an add-in card, such as an HBA card or, in my case a Mezza adapter (pictured)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/atn2r7r0suaf1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e17b1c8b51521d53721a330778de7a0000fd707\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fx3dkj5suaf1.png?width=430&format=png&auto=webp&s=565eb652da85b87e3b43bcec5c91d6ee4b1580cb\n\nThe Mezza adapter plugs into the onboard expansion port (flex connector), not a PCI express port, has an onboard controller and supports another SATA port and a USB port. I've been able to boot the P510 from the USB port so I assume the adapter is working.\n\nI stupidly assumed that plugging the backplanes into the mini-SAS ports would allow them to work normally, as the card would work as an HBA in pass through mode. Unfortunately, I get nothing at all; no drive spin or any other action. I now realise there's also a dedicated RAID card, but why would you put mini-SAS ports on an add-in card if you couldn't use them?\n\nHas anyone seen one of these cards before and knows how to get them to work or if they'll work how I need them to?\n\nI can get hold of an LSI adapter card with the right ports, but if I can use what I have, that would be great...\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.  \n",

    "selftext": "I am a beginner so please be nice :)\n\nI want to upgrade my NAS from a boring old tower laying arround to something mounted in a rack. For this I looked up some parts that would be needed and have found the things that I need (except an HBA), but I am unsure with two components:\n\nCase: Silverstone RM22-312  \nPSU: Inter-Tech ASPOWER R2A-DV0800-N\n\n1. My first concern is if the PSU delivers enough power, 800W is probably enough but I want to make sure that this is enough for the System and the hard drives. The system that would be in use is currently using a \\~300W PSU with no GPU installed. Sadly I cant tell you any specific parts as I am currently on vacation.\n2. The second thought I have is noise. I chose this specific PSU because I can buy it relatively cheap but the problem is that I dont know if this PSU would be be very loud or if this is one of these \"quiet\" PSUs. If not, what other options are there that are affordable and quiet?\n3. And the third problem is the HBA (which is the thing that I have absolutely no idea of what to choose). What HBA would work with the case/has three (or more) mini-SAS-HD connectors?",

Preferably from a simple linux machine using a WOL client.\n\nI understand you're going for something more robust but that at least allows you to eliminate the computer you're wishing to wake as the problem child. There's some various nuances of how WOL is implemented for a sleeping computer but waking a powered off computer (albeit with power still in the motherboard though. ie. plugged in) is pretty reliable in today's hardware.\n\nThe other issue you may run into is the \"client\" computer sending the magic packet. Hence why I suggest booting up an old laptop with a wired NIC into a linux distro and using the simple terminal *wol* program. For example, IOS devices going back several versions limit app's ability to utilize/analyze MAC addresses from the system's API. Personally, I don't trust using little apps just for that stuff but.. basically, I wouldn't be surprised if you dig further into this and find that the device sending the magic packets is the real culprit to your frustration. Not the computer you're trying to wake up.\n\nI'd test the dead simple implementation I mentioned and then go from there until you get the setup you want.",

Send the WoL packet to the subnet's broadcast address (.255 on the subnet) rather than directly to the PC's IP address\n\nIf you're trying to send the packet to that computer's IP address specifically and the NIC isn't 'on' enough to actually grab down an IP address from DHCP, it's fairly likely that the magic packet won't reach the PC, in my experience. WoL is primarily based on MAC addresses. First one will make the router remember the mapping between MAC and IP address while the PC is off, and the second one will (if your router's firmware is properly configured) blast the magic packet out to everything connected to it.\n\nAlso, WoL working is *highly* dependent on UEFI settings being lined up in a *very exact* way on some of my PCs, with some settings that wouldn't appear to affect WoL, or in menus not relating to power management, being part of this. I can't really advise you on that, because it varies so widely by manufacturer.",

I have yet to run into a WOL device that doesn't respond to that.\n\nThe issue is that's not the only way to send the magic packet. It can be sent as a layer 3 transport payload. Essentially, an actual packet that has IP addressing and port information in the header.\n\nA transport packet like that can be picked up by docker because the host machine for the containers and the physical network switches are going to have that IP address and port information in their ARP/forwarding tables. Boom-bada-bing, it spins up.\n\nPretty much every physical device though isn't gonna have that third networking layer initialized while it's \"powered off\". But you'll notice that when power is plugged into the physical box, the NIC still blinks. It's receiving traffic and will act on certain payloads, like a barebones, layer2, WOL instruction.\n\nThe issue with using apps that live in mobile ecosystems to power on physical devices is that an app actually interacts with the physical phone's hardare exclusively through the APIs provided by the manufactures. That's an extra \"layer\" (programmatically if you would) between the app and the actual network traffic generated. This extra layer is a security feature which yields the side effect of limiting certain types of \"specialized\" network traffic. This added layer doesn't exist on computers, if I want to sent a very specific type of network frame, I can do it. You just can't do that on a phone without root access.\n\nAnd as it is, the type of frame used to wake a physical machine from a powered down state requires that specificity, that barebones-ness. Otherwise the NIC doesn't process it.\n\nIt's not that WOL doesn't work for physical devices, it's that most people aren't sending the network message correctly.",

Real problem came later as I loaded it with some disks, the disk at pos. 2.6 gave always an error \"data path to the disk is not redundant\" no matter what i did. Swapped caddies etc. After a while I discovered, that it seems that the I/O connector on the backplane of the LFF disk self has couple pins that have bend and are most likely not connected.   \nSo finally my question. Has anybody ever opened up one of these LFF disk self chassis and could give some tips? I'm not afraid to use some force as I cannot return the item any more and got nothing to lose basically. I'd like to see if I could just bend those pins back, or maybe source a new backplane if they are even on the market. Buying a new case is an option too later, but it's just frustrating to spend all that money for the new h/w and especially for shipping such a monster.\n\nIt looks to me quite solid packet, but somehow they must have got that backplane in there in the first place.\n\nThanks!",

Lastly another 9 screws and then you can pull out the backplane. Job done. \n\nI'll have play with the pins, but I'm afraid i need to buy a new chassis.",

    "selftext": "So… I’ve been headed deep down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to open a few services up to the internet, and feeling like as a non security professional I could easily create a massive attack surface through a subtle or not-so-subtle misconfiguration. The stack is non-trivial.  I’d been on a roll recently because I got pocket-id working with passcodes in front of Immich and proxmox and pangolin… having 1Password passcodes with faceid just work for logging in to Proxmox was amazing!!! …but have been really skittish about moving to LDAP with fantasies of being locked out of everything if I didn’t get my break glass local accounts set up perfectly and screwed something up. I know I’ll eventually need to do traefik anyways but…\n\n…along comes cloudflared as a solution and I’m like, “huh, isn’t that cheating?” But then I realize that maybe I’m just trying to be macho and own my own stack, and this is a situation in which I should just outsource the security. \n\nAnyways, and yes I’m aware this Is a rambling post, part of me wishes that I could use sso from cloudflare inside my perimeter too, though that is lazy.  I haven’t implemented it yet, but I think that I should probably choose my battles, and exposing public ports is probably one in prefer not to have. I have plenty of battles still to fight…\n- learning enough about networking to retire my UDM Pro and move to a Topton OPNsense\n- building proper routing tables on my own for the first time so I can keep my site-to-site VPN going without relying on Unifi Site magic\n- getting smart about the combo of ZFS snapshots, Kopia, syncthing & rsync\n- building my first proper NAS from parts purchased here\n- …\n\nI think I can outsource security. \n\nI think I can. \n\nI think I can. \n\nCan I?",

Here's a step-by-step guide that might help:\n\n1. **Power cycle**: Try unplugging the power cords, holding the power button for 30 seconds, and then plugging everything back in. This can sometimes reset the iDRAC.\n2. **Firmware reset**: You can try resetting the firmware to its default settings. Check the Dell documentation for instructions on how to do this.\n3. **Serial console**: Since you've already soldered the UART connection, you can try accessing the iDRAC via serial console. This might give you more insight into what's going on.\n4. **iDRAC recovery**: If the above steps don't work, you might need to use the iDRAC recovery process. This involves creating a bootable USB drive and using it to recover the iDRAC firmware.\n\nIf you're still stuck, feel free to provide more details about your setup and what you've tried so far. I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot!",

Yes, I'm fairly new to the trade. The challenge here in India is that refurbished and used devices are often unreliable, many have been tampered with or contain cheap replacement parts. Even with N100 PCs, there aren’t any trustworthy brands offering them at reasonable prices. I'm considering starting with a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB). Once I get familiar with the setup and gain some hands-on experience, I plan to invest in a more powerful device in a couple of months to serve as my full-fledged home lab.",

    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI’m currently in the learning phase and starting to dive into networking, VLANs, and firewalls. To experiment, I got myself a second, separate internet connection at home so I don’t mess up the main household network while I play around.\n\nI’m trying to wrap my head around what a good setup would look like, both for learning and eventually for a more permanent deployment. The idea is to go deep into firewall rules, VLAN segmentation, pentesting, etc., and once I’m confident the setup is solid, roll it out as my main network.\n\nRight now I’m kind of torn between a few options and could use some advice:\n\n1. **Virtualize OPNsense (& firewall) inside Proxmox** – pros: flexible, snapshot-able, easy to restore; cons: maybe not as “real” as hardware? Risk of exposure of the hypervisor?\n2. **Virtualize the router but use a dedicated hardware firewall** – not sure if this even practical\n3. **Keep the ISP simple router or buy a \"prosumer\" router and drop in a hardware firewall before or after it** – is this even a thing that makes sense?\n4. **Go full bare metal: OPNsense on hardware + dedicated hardware firewall** – feels solid but less flexible for tinkering?\n5. **Bare metal OPNsense + firewall on the same physical machine** – a single box doing it all; maybe a nice balance, but is that too risky or limiting?\n\nI’d love to hear how others approached this stage, or what you'd recommend for someone just starting out.",

If you virtualise your firewall (which for many also serves as the network's main router) then you will necessarily have to take it down for every unrelated hardware modification to your hypervisor. It can be done and many do it, but it will be very annoying if you play around with configurations a lot. I personally want my firewall to reliably be up and running all of the time, not depending on any other device in the network. That's why it gets its own box.",

[Reference video](https://youtu.be/hSOFshCkSys?si=M6YyRT5YNBxA_iBZ)\n\nThe issue with virtualization, if you need to reboot your hypervisor, your Internet will go down. This is where proxmox clustering helps. (Note the video above is not true HA)\n\n>2. Virtualize the router but use a dedicated hardware firewall – not sure if this even practical\n\nNot practical.

Go full bare metal: OPNsense on hardware + dedicated hardware firewall – feels solid but less flexible for tinkering?\n\nI don't think this is less flexible. Read forest point above on OPNsense virtualization \n\n>5. Bare metal OPNsense + firewall on the same physical machine – a single box doing it all; maybe a nice balance, but is that too risky or limiting?\n\nDon't understand how this is different than number 4. Unless you mean you want to use OPNsense as a router and use a separate firewall?\n\nIn that case, it's easier if OPNsense is both. \n\nHope that helps",

Two power supplies, two motherboards (or whatever it uses), additional dimms, it all takes more power. Possibly more if you go for high need networking and the switches to go with it. (my 10gbe switch alone is drawing over 25W and that's probably not even high compared to some).\n\n15TB is nothing for storage now days. Honestly, just buy two drives and make a mirror instead of raid5 or equivalent. Both protect from just 1 drive failure, and it's less power to drive, less heat generated, fewer slots taken. A minimum of 4 drives, but get to 5 or more and you should be using raid 6 rather than raid 5.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you actually need a NAS, you just need storage. If you need that storage available when your computer is off, I kind of get it. Otherwise, why? Install proxmox, use ZFS. It's not difficult to setup your zfs maintenance and shares, assuming you even need it. Performance will be far better than dealing with a network connection.\n\nWhen you need something like 60TB or more of storage, at least 6 drives or more, then consider building a NAS box. You'll probably have more than one system by that point.\n\nIn all honestly, with a fairly static set of data like videos and images, just keep your storage on mergefs and snapraid. Much and more flexible to extend and in the case of multiple drive failures you can still read the drives that didn't fail (non-parity drives). Raid, you'd just lose all the data. You can even increase the number of parity drives as the number of drives increase. I don't think ZFS supports that.  Unraid I think does.  When starting with something low like 15TB, thinking of what you'd need to expand down the road is worthwhile.",

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm planning a server upgrade and would love some input from those more experienced.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n* **Device:** Beelink Mini S12 Pro (N100) running Ubuntu 25.04\n* **Stack:** Plex + the usual \\*arr tools (Sonarr, Radarr, etc.) all running in Docker\n* **Storage:** Yottamaster 2-bay USB-C enclosure with 2× Seagate Exos X20 18TB drives\n\n**What I like:**\n\n* It's portable - I move countries every few years for work, and this setup fits in a backpack as carry-on.\n* Low power consumption.\n* It’s been a great way to get back into Linux and learn the \\*arr stack.\n\n**What I don't like / concerns:**\n\n* **No redundancy** \\- if a drive fails, I lose years of carefully curated media.\n* **Storage limits** \\- drives are nearly full, and I’d need a new enclosure to expand.\n* **Performance** \\- Plex sometimes maxes out the CPU, especially during transcoding. It runs hot and occasionally stutters on Apple TV, possibly due to network issues but maybe also server load.\n\nI’m moving to China shortly, where I’ll finally have decent access to online shopping again. I’m considering using this as an opportunity to build something a little more scalable and reliable - something with:\n\n* Redundancy (RAID? SnapRAID? ZFS?)\n* Better thermal/performance headroom\n* Expandable storage\n* Ideally still semi-portable (or at least shippable every few years)\n\nIf you were in my position - prioritising **reliability, performance, and semi-portability** \\- what would you build next?\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.

Apparently the 100.100.100.100 DNS entry is being inserted into all of VMs from Tailscale and tonight it is not responding for me. I tested it by inserting the public DNS entries and it worked fine until a reboot reinserted the entries. My question is if magic dns goes down a lot or if this is just a one time thing.

    "selftext": "Should I spend the extra for a Ubiquiti sfp+ 10gbe to rj45  connector, or will the generic off brand ones on Amazon perform just as well? \n\nI only just realized that my sfp+ WAN in on my Ubiquiti UXG fiber gateway can be switched to a LAN port. I don't have fiber Internet, just 600mbps cable, so I'm not running it to the sfp+ wan input, but the rj45 2.5gbe input\n\nI have one Ubiquiti 10gbe sfp+ to rj45 already running to a network switch, but if I can use the other to directly connect to a Dell r730 10gbe, my VMs there should have a wider bandwidth connection to play with instead of 2.5gbe off the switch. I only just realized that my add-in 2.5gbe x2 Intel 226-v NIC won't actually let me use both ports simultaneously without breaking one of them. I'm also pretty sure that it's what's causing pcie errors on warm reboots, so it would be nice to just remove that NIC to begin with and have a 10gbe connection in its place\n\nYes, I realize now that I should have just gone with 10gbe all across the board, but that ship has sailed and I don't want to replace the 2.5gbe gateway and switches just a few months after buying them. The only thing on the LAN that can use a 10gbe direct connection is the r730 anyway. 10gbe to the network switch was because it's got plenty of things connected to it, so a 10gbe uplink between the switch and the gateway seemed like a better use of what I thought was my only 10gbe lan connection on the gateway. Now, I've realized that I actually have 2 10gbe lan connections, so I might as well use them",

    "selftext": "# 🎧 Free Local Music Server + Secure Remote Access – Made This for a Client, Sharing for Fun!\n\nHey folks —  \nI’m KC, a one-man MSP out of rural Georgia. A client came in needing help transferring music from vinyl to Apple Music. He was copying songs to USB, sorting manually, and emailing links to himself (no joke).\n\nI got bored... and built him a secure, on-site **music + file server** he could access from *anywhere* — with:\n\n* ✅ **Zero open ports**\n* ✅ **Custom domain** (via Cloudflared tunneling)\n* ✅ **File Browser UI** (to drag and drop music)\n* ✅ **Terminal access** in the browser (optional)\n* ✅ **Raspberry Pi powered**\n* ✅ **Free to use as long as you’re not selling music**\n\nNow he has a simple, secure way to grab or share files — and I just thought it was a fun little thing worth showing off.\n\n🎁 **GitHub repo:**  \n[https://github.com/Fruitloop24/pan-pup](https://github.com/Fruitloop24/pan-pup)\n\n🛠️ Built mostly with Python, Bash, and Cloudflare Tunnel.  \n🎵 You can add your own music, give users custom subdomains, and access everything remotely with no headaches.\n\nWould love any feedback, suggestions, or questions. Might keep adding to this!",

The Mac mini will serve Home Assistant, DNS sinkhole for ad blocking, plus whatever other containers I feel like playing with.\n\nEverything is in a 12U mini rack (Rackmate T2), behind the rack I designed and printed some power brick holders for the switches and the gateway, and then a simple PDU/power strip at the bottom. I plan to add a NAS of some sort with 10GbE later on, which is the primary purpose of having the 10g core switch and stuff. I have the entire rack plugged into an external UPS (DJI Power 1000).\n\nNot shown is two U7 Pro XGS APs, one upstairs and one downstairs. 6GHz coverage is meh (pretty much have to be in the same room), but 5GHz and 2.4 is stellar - really love these APs especially the dedicated spectrum analyzer and channel optimization.",

It offers built-in redundancy, snapshots, compression, strong data integrity, making it ideal for managing VMs and containers. It works best on bare metal with HBAs in IT mode, and you really should use ecc ram if you got it. If you are building a multi-node cluster and want shared storage, Ceph is pretty cool, but it requires more work. For simpler setups, ext4 can work well but lacks advanced features. Keep in mind that IT mode disables RAID and turns the HBA into a dumb pass-through device which is what you want for a zfs based system.",

It scales appropriately to the amount of power the system has and whether you set It to Light, Average or Heavy use of the hardware. It can make use of GPUs if available.\n\nI've run it on my laptop during the pandemic for many hours at a time. The power brick did give up a month ago but that laptop is in daily use so it could be unrelated. I've also run it on my PVE hypervisors, which use low-voltage bricks as well. All are still functional. Laptop power bricks are designed to supply maximum draw indefinitely as long as they have air around then for cooling - note that laptop bricks are also overspec'd because they are able to charge the laptop even when it's under max load, so if your battery is at 100%, it'll be running with some headroom.\n\nOld desktop PCs make great servers. However, think carefully about the amount of power you're going to go with - if you want to contribute without raising your energy bills massively, get a machine that's as new as possible because they are very energy efficient. High-end GPUs and high core counts will allow you to take on very complex jobs. As for noise, well it's unavoidable when you're working a PC hard - you'll have to deal with the heat somehow. Liquid cooling can help. So you're into the realm of a multi-thousand-dollar gaming PC. USFFs like my hypervisors can actually be very quiet even when under full load, though that's because they use low TDP chips that can't process as much as high TDP ones. You'll have to decide where you draw the line.\n\nIt's great that you are looking to contribute to the cause. I'm looking to get back into it once the heatwave here passes and I'm not struggling to keep my house cool!",

GRUB will scan and assemble the mdadm array.\n\nYou can configure GRUB to have a Windows boot options but from what I remember from the last dual boot setup I did, when Windows is selected you leave GRUB and drop into the Windows Bootloading.. system.. thinger..\n\nI was originally thinkin', just use mdadm for your software raid and then on the array setup the various Windows partitions along side the Linux partitions or perhaps a partition for LVM Volume Group. Upon thinking though, that's gonna be a no-go because when you're dropped into the Windows Bootloading.. system.. thinger.. it isn't gonna be aware of the things GRUB was.\n\nIf you flip the script slightly though, and use a \"windows software raid\". More specifically an Intel RST raid, you can bring those up in mdadm.\n\n    IMSM_NO_PLATFORM=1 mdadm --assemble --scan --verbose\n\nThe trick there will become configuring GRUB correctly to assemble the RST raid when you wish to boot in linux.\n\nI haven't personally tried this but just poking around the internet for fifteen minutes, from my experience the pieces seem to be in place that might it a doable thing to have both Windows and Linux on the same software raid.\n\nIn practicality though... You're trying to put things together that just don't jive. You're better off going hardware raid (150 bucks for a decent Intel card) or settling for one of the OS's to also live on your \"boot drive\" while the other enjoys the raid drives.",

    "selftext": "Hello all, I've been lurking in here for a short time as I've been trying to learn, but now that I \"think\" I have an idea of what \"HomeLab\" even is, I'm looking to jump in and see where it takes me. I'd appreciate some guidance as I am getting started. My current network diagram is attached for reference. (It's probably super wrong but I just googled an example and went off that)\n\nI’ve got a basic home network setup with the following equipment I'm hoping to adapt to homelab stuff:\n\n* ISP-provided ONT for fiber (1GB)\n* CenturyLink C4000XG router/AP combo (from ISP)\n* WatchGuard Firebox T30-W\n* UniFi Switch 16 (gen1)\n* Spare laptop running Windows 11 to experiment with.\n\nMy household devices include:\n\n* Main tower PC\n* Printer\n* 2 cell phones\n* 4 Nest cams\n* Apple TV 4K (HomeKit hub)\n* Sony TV\n* 6 Wi-Fi plugs\n* Smart Thermostat\n* 2 WIFI garage door openers\n\nAll connected to the C4000XG. I’ve set up the Firebox T30-W with its own Wi-Fi network for the laptop as a separate homelab network.\n\nLong-term Goals: From what I've seen on this sub, I’d like to get into self-hosting for storage/backup, a media server, an ad blocker, wired security cameras/NVR, and self-hosted email.\n\nHonestly I like the idea of cutting the cord for all these monthly subscription services I pay for now, and I hate how much privacy I've slowly given up over time. I understand it won't all come at once, and I am fully aware I am setting myself up for WAY more complexity. It's on me for not getting started and learning all this sooner.\n\nI’m wondering:\n\n* Is my current homelab self hosting stuff (Firebox as a separate network) a good starting point, or should I adjust something?\n* Tips/recommendations on software for the self-hosting projects I mentioned above?\n* Where would/should I incorporate VLANs? or other ways to further isolate my homelab from the main network? if necessary?\n* Should I continue running Windows 11 on the spare Laptop? I've been thinking of trying Linux\n* Trying to learn as much as I can with the current equipment but I'm open to getting additional/newer equipment if needed.\n* I eventually would like to ditch the ISP router/ap (C4000XG)\n\nAny advice or scrutiny would be greatly appreciated as I get started. Thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fv7bvnuhraf1.png?width=2951&format=png&auto=webp&s=eff9723060b1fc13cdbe9c00397927d4229818d7",

    "selftext": "Hi all, I'm not sure if i am doing this right.\n\nI need help with planning my first lab. I have used a lot of ready-built equipment in the past, but now that I am doing this for myself and not on the company dime, I want to set this up just right for me.\n\nI'm looking to do a Home NAS with three-tier storage, two focused on my home workload for my business, and one for Media storage and home automation. Currently, I run a mixed Plex/Jellyfin server for the Media server, and looking to migrate to Jellyfin only. Second, I am looking to set up a Redundant Server Head Unit, that are mirrored, hosting Proxmox, which in turn, hosts PFSENSE Router, a Dedicated Docker VM(RetroNAS, namely) on a separate internal storage array, and TrueNAS. Storage for TrueNAS would be through a separate external Drive Enclosure rack unit, connected over HBA, with the adapter passed through to the TrueNAS VM.\n\nTrueNAS Storage would have a Media and automation tier, which is all spinning rust, and a two-tier system with SSD for high-demand data, and data that needs permanent storage on high-speed storage. Second Tier would be spinning rust with Read and write cache.\n\nNow, after describing the broad goal of this, I need help with 1. how to configure the installations to work on Proxmox, since I only have a passing understanding of this, and want to learn more. 2. Since all of this will have high hardware demand, what kind of hardware should I be looking at to make this happen? I would like to have this be stable with a lot of headroom for further additions and longevity to make upgrading something I can avoid for a while. Finally, 3. What modifications can I make to reduce noise, heat, and dust, and optimise the software to reduce unnecessary system strain to cut down on power consumption, and generally wearing out the hardware?\n\nLike I said at the start, I'm not sure if I am posting this right, and I know that this may seem like a lot of inexperienced nonsense, but I want to learn more, and set up something to make working from home easier and general home life outside of work for me and my family, nicer. So I hope the collective knowledge of this community can help.\n\nThank you for your time.",

I'm new to homelabing world, i wanna build my first homeserver where i can host a media server with jellyfinn, a file server which can run nextcloud suite and immich, sum n8n instances and python scripts. Im here looking for guidance as to what to buy, the twist is, i count with a budget of 420usd and it can only be built through amazon cause i got sum giftcards from there and its the only site that sends shipping to Argentina. Plus, as the shipping is kinda restricted it should only be new stuff. Hope this post reaches a kind helping hand that can help me build a setup.\n\nThanks and Kind Regards.",

An iBall tower PC (Core 2 Duo and 4GB RAM). This is my media server, running Plex, Jellyfin, and the \\*arr stack.  \n3.) A Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM). This is running networking-related services like AdGuard Home, Gotify, Miniflux, etc.  \n4.) A Compaq Presario C700 (Core 2 Duo and 4GB RAM). This is running services like Nextcloud, Paperless-ngx, Mealie, etc.\n\nThere’s also a Digisol router placed next to the Raspberry Pi 4 which currently isn’t being used, it's just sitting there for now. Initially, I planned to install OpenWrt on it, but turns out it doesn't support OpenWrt.\n\nLet me know in the comments what you think of my setup and what else I could add to improve it!",

(Bonus: is it scalable and \\~$150/unit?)\n* Anyone developing an alternative? I’d be very interested in following or testing a real open IP-KVM project—especially if it’s actively being worked on.\n\n**Note:**  \nIf a solution can’t serve 20+ units easily, I don’t really consider it a true IP-based KVM—it needs to scale cleanly, not just handle a couple nodes.\n\nLove to hear real-world setups—even if it’s outside my budget.

They ship to the USA, or you can just buy them on Amazon at a markup. They're already pretty cheap so I opted for that, to have the option to return them easily if needed.\n\nThey have multiple different configurations available. I have the PCIE version in one server, and the \"Lite\" version connected to a Mac Mini. The PCIE one is great if you have a slot for it. It makes for a very tidy setup with full control of the power and reset buttons, easy to wire up internally. It can be powered over PCIE, or externally powered by USB or PoE, or multiple options at once. It has built in Tailscale, which was great for me. \n\nFor a less critical Mac Mini in my rack, I opted for the extremely cheap Lite version of the NanoKVM. It's a bare board, no case, and it's only powered over USB from the computer, so if your PC shuts off power to its USB ports when off or during boot you'd want the regular non-Lite version, but the Lite version saved me like $30 and works fine for my application. No power button control either, but that wouldn't have worked on the Mini anyway. I was shocked at how useful and usable the NanoKVM Lite was for its price. They're so cheap that if I was deploying a ton of machines and could work around the lack of power button control and external power, I'd slap one on each.\n\nWhen the NanoKVM first came out there was some drama around it not releasing its source code, and its security. Some of that has been resolved, but I'm not clear to what degree. I'm not exposing mine to the internet so I wasn't too concerned about security, but YMMV.",

It’s a clever workaround—I can see it making a lot of sense for certain homelab scenarios, especially if you only need to control a handful of systems.\n\nI’m working with 10+ nodes (and likely more soon), so I’m always on the lookout for scalable, low-friction KVM solutions. Your approach looks cheap and functional for a small number of machines, but I’m wondering: do you think this kind of hack would actually hold up if you needed to manage 10, 20, or even 60 nodes? At that scale, the soldering, wiring, and maintaining a bunch of ESP devices and cheap KVMs seems like it could turn into a rat’s nest pretty quickly—plus, there’s no EDID emulation or true remote video.\n\nJust to clarify my requirements:\n\n* **20+ nodes** (with potential to grow)\n* **BIOS-level remote console** (need to see POST and troubleshoot failures—not just switch inputs)\n* **Ideally sub-$150 total** for a working solution\n* **Minimal ongoing maintenance** (no constant babysitting, reflashing, or resoldering)\n* **Stable, low-latency video/input** (at least 1080p60)\n* **Reliable EDID emulation** (so windows don’t jump or monitors disconnect)\n* **Cable and power management that scales cleanly** (not a wiring nightmare)\n* **Prefer plug-and-play, or at least a well-documented, repeatable setup**\n\nI’m not the world’s best with a soldering iron—functional, but not efficient—so I’m hesitant to dive in unless there’s a way to keep things manageable and reliable at scale. For now, I’m holding out for a real IP-KVM (JetKVM or a used enterprise model), but I’m always interested to hear real-world experience. How has this worked for you over time? Any unexpected maintenance headaches?\n\nThanks for the detailed write-up—super helpful seeing what goes into these builds!",

        "body": "Cat6a has enough bandwidth, that it's gonna be utilized for a long time. Predicting things like this is a fools errand but... it's gonna be with us as a competitive standard for the next 20 years easily. Honestly, RJ6 gets overlooked for its future-proofing ability. It's shielded, 2GHz bandwidth. For my house I ran two CAT6A to every room and one RJ6.\n\nConduit, fiber, always adds that extra capability to your home. But when all the building material costs are adding up.. sometimes that beautiful gas range with pop up exhaust starts to seem like a better place to put money. I personally have a little conduit between certain areas of the house but didn't go to every room. It's just not worth the cost because you want ULTIMATE SPEED, EVERYWHERE. I'd rather spend my money on backup power generation, for example.\n\nTo each their own.\n\nOne Top-Tip I can give though, if your equipment rack is going to be generating significant heat, I'd get a couple HVAC professionals thoughts on heat extraction. And personally, I'd have them plan a system for the house and then add in, \"I'm thinking this closet is gonna get a bit hot, what are your thoughts about getting heat out?\" I wouldn't lead with that.  \nEssentially, you don't want to have an HVAC system that runs the house built to accommodate your equipment rack. Your home is for living. And your heat extraction requirements may change overtime.\n\nIf you're gonna be housing a decent amount of equipment, Instead of going balls to the wall on network connectivity you'll be better served segmenting the equipment from the rest of your life. Meaning dedicated heat extraction and electrical distribution. \n\nRather that be just exhausting it (perhaps back into the air return of the main system) or even active cooling with a separate mini-split type of setup.  \n  \nAlso, a separate breaker panel for the equipment and other electrical service related to the equipment which feeds back to a service disconnect box that sits between your homes main panel, the panel for your equipment, utility line in, and possible generator power. This way, in extended power outage situations you can better manage the distribution. For example, I have my garage freezer and fridge tied into my \"equipment\" panel. I can disconnect from the utilities electricity and power the house on the main generator while the garage freezer/fridge and the server equipment on a smaller generator. If I had a more robust UPS setup I could backfeed that electrical \"service\" from the batteries to my office outlets that also live on the equipment sub-panel. That's getting pretty reckless at that point though and sorta defeats the purpose of \"UPS\"  (I obviously wouldn't suggest that) but for illustrative purposes it's a possibility.\n\nTis some thoughts from my experience of doing a new build as a systems nerd. I gotta say, I wired up a lot of networking. But that's not what I spent most of my time planning out. You're not building an equipment room. You're building a whole house and all the systems that make it a home.",

        "body": "I did a renovation which placed some constraints on my server room closet. Things to think about:\n1. Do you want home automation?\n2. Do you want a whole home music system?\n3. Are you a big video consumer or just need one or zero TV locations?\n4. Do you want a media room?\n5. How many offices in the house?\n6. Square footage and WiFi access reach indoors and outdoors?\n7. Any other equipment like security cameras?\n8. Do you want a home lab for experimentation or is it more for media?\n\nThe value of cat6 copper is that you can ship power to devices and power cycle them remotely, if need be, with a PoE switch. You should still have power outlets near all planned devices just in case. Make your networking equipment faster than you currently expect you’ll need because devices will eventually catch up. Have equipment that can handle VLANs and use them to isolate gear. I have separate VLANs for cameras, IoT, guests, family, etc.\n\nAirflow for heat dissipation is crucial. Make sure you dump the air somewhere and it should be conditioned air, not outside air which can create dampness and other problems. I dump the air from my server closet into a nearby bathroom to warm it.\n\nI did a home run for all speakers in my house to whole home amps. Part of me wishes I’d done Sonos, but I also kind of hate Sonos (we have it at a vacation home). Amps can overheat if not managed in the rack. If I had the room, I’d have done two racks: IT and AV.\n\nUPS is vital! I also have power conditioners that can remotely power cycle equipment. The value of not visiting the rack, pulling it out and flipping switches or pulling plugs is high to me, as you may be able to tell.\n\nI wish I’d run fiber from my closet to the two offices. I think a high speed backbone in a couple of places or between floors would have been good. Even conduit was a challenge, but could have been done, I guess. Didn’t have the foresight for a couple of key fiber locations. It’s not terrible, just wish I had it for expansion/speed purposes. Honestly, my main better bottleneck is my internet connection, not my internal network speed.\n\nOur “media room” is the family room, which I did a home run for to the server closet. In retrospect, I wish I’d had all of that equipment in a second location. They may have mitigated cramming so much in the rack. However, I was worried about noise from the fans cooling the media equipment (legit concern) and an ability to cool the equipment in the family room.\n\nMost of this was because I wasn’t designing from scratch. We had the pre-existing shell which is a thin, railroad car 100+ year old house and weren’t going to rip out the entire insides and rebuild. We nearly did as we pulled out all the old plaster lathe and sheet rocked, which made wiring easy.\n\nMy preference was to wire everything I could wire, then use wifi.\n\nA great way to sound proof is to put the equipment on a different floor in the basement, for example.",

Run your services separately from each other as VMs. Export them to a file and copy that file to a backup 'server' on a regular basis.

The answer to the first is often \"a lot\", and the second is increasingly a resounding \"no\". But I've always liked doing things myself. I grew up watching my dad and uncles build houses, fix their own cars, and doing all sorts of other DIY activities of the day, so I have that mindset - except I don't like getting dirty as much. So I'll pay someone run my CAT-6 throughout my house, but I'll terminate the drops myself. \n\n\\--\n\nHowever, that is a summary from a lifetime of experience and 30-years of professional development working in tech.  Back when I was a youngster starting out in my career and broadband was still in early deployments, my \"war room\" consisted of just an old Mac and a handful of PCs I built out of discarded spare parts I grabbed from my job. I didn't *plan* to run anything, I just had the computing power to run stuff when I had an idea I wanted to try. Back then, self-hosting was really about running a linux distro, maybe your own web/ftp server that your friends used, mail services via sendmail+fetchmail (and probably telnet into your box to run PINE in front of your friends so you can show off reading your email remotely), and small stuff like that.\n\nAs my hardware configurations have changed over the years, the number of things i can do has increased but my available time to do those things has decreased, so now I tend to use the time calculations above.\n\nLet your homelab grow organically. If you have a box and want to do something with it, pick one thing to do first. Just one. *Only* one. Focus on how to make that work. Then, move to the next thing. You might have to redo something on the first one to account for the second, but that's part of the process. If you need a more systematic approach (or maybe if you keep shifting focus mid-project), make a list of all the things you want to do and rank them in some order of priority. If you're replacing a paid subscription service, then those projects might be more important than a net-new pet project idea. Or if you have family using those services, maybe those are the *last* you replace, to avoid disrupting other people's access.\n\nI've long since learned that when I start overthinking things, I stop having fun, and that's *at least* *half* of why I self-host anything at all. So if I'm not having fun, I'm probably doing it wrong.",

Initially it was at home on an Internet plan that had a static IP address, running Sendmail with Spamassassin, and later Postfix with postgrey - my domain was registered in 2001. When I was no longer able to get enough bandwidth at a reasonable price, I moved into collocation. But it's been like 10 years since I decided it wasn't worth the effort or cost to maintain.

    "selftext": "Hello all! I'm looking to build a pi 5 server mainly to run a password manager and media server. I have a lot of questions and am not able to find clear answers so I'm turning to you guys. The reason I'm going with a pi 5 is cost mostly, I've already looked at the mini PC options and they are not as cost effective. \n\nMy use case: stream (only) 4k bluray remux files from my personal collection to 1 device (TV). Run a local password manager (had a bad experience with BitWarden recently). Media will be stored on an external 3.5\" HDD connected through USB 3.\n\nI know that the pi5 doesn't have enough horsepower to transcode 4k video. But has anyone had experience just plain old streaming 4k remux files or files with similar bitrate? Does it work smoothly?\n\nIs it worth it to go for the 8GB model or is the 4GB model fine for my use case?\n\nShould I install the OS on a microSD or a small SSD with a m.2 hat? Does it make a difference in performance?\n\nWhat OS should I go for? I'm ok with learning commandline for SSH.\n\nIs jellyfin the best free media server software? Does it automatically populate movie metadata etc and does it work smoothly in your experience?\n\nWill streaming outside my local network (through tailscale) function smoothly without transcoding?\n\nI'm planning on purchasing a 3.5\" 10TB HDD and an enclosure to go with it. A buddy of mine has had an issue where his drive does not power on or mount properly after a power loss. Anyway I can prevent this issue? Should I just get an enclosure without a power button so that I don't have to power it on physically everytime there is a power loss? Or is something else the issue?\n\nSorry if these questions seem obvious but I'm not able to find s lot of people with the exact use case as mine and I really want some first hand accounts before delving into this.",

Some models when combined with the right motherboards support ECC which would allow you to re-use your ram.\n\nI'd hit pcpartspicker.com and see what it suggests.  You might be able to hit the budget going new or seach the second handmarket for the hardware.",

No matter what I do I can’t get into it, I’ve factory reset it from the bios,tired putting on static IP and nothing works. Cables are good because I can access severe through the TrueNAS and I tired the same cable on the drac. I did notice that I get no indicator light on the nic that there’s activity. \nDoes anyone have an idea for me to try?",

I have setup a Fractal Define R6, with i5-8400, refurbished Intel S4500 240GB SSD for boot, and a refurbished HDD for storing surveillance footage. I think the case can hold up to 8 more HDDs easily, which I can support by adding a PCIE sata expansion card. I will be running everything on Debian, with podman containers and openZFS for ZFS.   \nMy plan is to add 4 x 8TB HDD in RAIDZ2 pool as my primary storage. I am leaning towards RAIDZ2 over mirrored RAID vdevs for more reliability over speed. Both options will give me similar storage capacity I believe. I do want to be able to swap out 8TB drives for 16 TB drives in future or add more drives to increase storage capacity if possible.   \nFor backup, I am not sure if I should add a similar 4 x 8TB RAIDZ2 pool, or if that's overkill. Instead, should I go with a simple 2x16TB mirrored vdev and supplement it with a single 16TB HDD that I plug in once in a while and store offline.  \nMy third stage backup plan is to upload to cloud storage like Backblaze B2 or Amazon S3 glacier deep archive.  \nLooking for any inputs/advice/recommendation",

I found out about Radxa from Jeff geerling so I started digging in Aliexpress until I found the \"gem\", the Radxa zero 3w (rk3566 based), it has 1, 2, 4, and 8Gb ram options and even has an emmc option. I even found [Joshua-Riek's ubuntu-rockchep](https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-rockchip) wich allows hardware acceleration (usefull for jellyfin). All of this combind with a 2230 nvme ssd with an enclosure (as small as it could be) along with a 180° angled usb c adapter I could make it compact and space efficient. It was getting hot so I added a 30mm fan and covered the Radxa with a 3d-printed enclosure (so I dont get pulled at the airport security, It happened once😅). As per the software, I used casaos because its easy, light, and it just works.\n\nNow it wont be a lab without networking so I paired it with th gl-inet byrel AX AKA the best travel router, try to change my mind. Until now everything went perfect but I didnt like that I have to plug them seperatly an that they dont have somthing like a ups so I added a powerbank that supports power pass through (it can power both the router and the server while its charging) so bonus points for making it run off-grid for about 6 hours so it can be used in plane, another bonus point for using one usb c port from my charger instead of tow, one last bonus point because it can charde my earphones and watch while running everything.\n\n\n\nHope you enjoyed reading this poorly organized midnight thoughts.",

It’s fully assembled with all side panels, front and rear doors, and a top panel installed. I also have servers installed (roughly 10U worth, mounted low in the rack), but even when I take everything out, the rack *still* wobbles noticeably side-to-side when I gently push it.\n\nThe base seems very solid and doesn’t move the wobble feels like the vertical posts are flexing slightly, as if they aren’t stiff enough or not properly braced at the top. All screws appear tight, and nothing is obviously bent or missing.\n\nI’ve checked that:\n\n* The rack is level using the adjustable feet\n* All panels and doors are properly mounted\n* There’s no damage to the frame or mounting points\n\nHas anyone had a similar issue with Minkels or other modular racks?  \nAny tips to reinforce it? I’m thinking of adding some custom steel L-brackets or an X-brace, unless there’s a better solution.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

I hope this does not break the rules.\n\nI needed a 3U case with space for 8 HDDs and two 5.25\" slots. This case was the only one I could find in the EU that met these requirements. The surprisingly low price should have been a warning sign though.\n\nAs the saying goes, you get what you pay for.\n\nThe case is cheap, many parts are flimsy, but that's not much of an issue, the real problem is the poor engineering.\n\nMost screws you need to access to service the components (the 5.25 slots or the 2.5 drives), are very hard to reach (you need a very long screw driver, and good luck with reaching the screw with the fingers), and two crucial one are located behind the rail mounts, requiring a rail removal to remove the 5.25 frame that is a requirement to mount the 2.5\" drives.\n\nLuckily I''ve planned to buy a 2.5 to 5.25 blackplane to fit into the case so I won't have to use the 2.5 bays but still this makes me mad, clearly whoever designed this case had never talked with anyone that ever serviced a server...\n\nThe fun part is that some screws are so hard to reach that even they could not, as a result the 3.5 blackplanes are partly unscrewed so its panels are wobbly and the drive caddies get stuck! \n\nTo remove some of the caddies you have to remove the one you can (usually the top one) and push the panels with the finger to be able to remove the one you need (so forget to hot swap those drives even if it should support that on paper).\n\nI hope the back plane works, I'm still waiting for the hdds to be shipped and I could not test it yet.\n\nI hope everything will fit together at the end.\n\nBye\n\nK",

    "selftext": "I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this, but you guys seem like the type of people to repurpose rack-mount servers into ZFS/unRAID boxes, so I figured I'd ask here.\n\nI have a 1U HP ProLiant server with 8 2.5\" hard drive bays, and they have the little LEDs that show disk activity and health.  When you use the built-in RAID controller, they light up as expected, but the problem with those is that you can't actually disable RAID and use them as a host bus adapter, and I want to do software RAID and not mess with that junk.\n\nSo I popped a LSI SAS2008 card in the PCI express slot and routed the cables to it, works fine and I can access all 8 disks individually at a hardware level - except unsurprisingly those LEDs are now off.\n\nI don't really care about the disk health stuff, but it would be nice to have them blink with I/O activity so I know when stuff is being written or it's rebuilding the array or whatever.  I know some RAID cards have pins on the board meant for connecting things but I don't know what they do and what the pinouts are.  Has anyone done this, or is it even possible?\n\nThanks\n\nEdit: I have the LSI card flashed in IT mode if you're wondering why I called it a RAID card. It's not doing hardware RAID but is the easiest way to connect 8 disks to a machine",

Both of them work with a LSI card in RAID mode (I don't really want to do software raid on that system), though I noticed with SAS drives the light gets inverted and it's solid on when there's *no* activity and flashes off when there is.\n\nWith this HP server, though, nothing lights up at all when I bypass the built in RAID card.

There are apps to update Cloudflare with your dynamic IP whenever it changes. Then, use something like Cloudflare Zero Trust to keep any bad actors or bots away from the login pages of Sonarr or Radarr or Overseerr. Do not set it up on Plex though.",

    "selftext": "Hello all,  \nI am creating a humble machine at home.  \nI had bought a motherboard B550 Pro4 with an AMD 16 core processor off a friend, and built around it.  \nIdeally I would like to make this to work, even just for the learning experience, I treat it as my sandbox (kind of).\n\nThe components and ports are listed below:\n\n* 4 SATA drives (on port 1,2,5,6 port 3 and 4 are not responding for some reason I abandoned them)\n* 1 NVMe on slot M2\\_1\n* 2 GPUs on PCIe slots 1 and 2\n\nI have installed proxmox and am creating VMs. VM means I want to pass through the GPUs (who would have guessed). Passthrough means IOMMU. Now this is the kicker:\n\n* I tried enabling all the usuals in BIOS (AER, ACS, IOMMU enabled, ARI Support, etc.)\n* It did not properly segregate the groups so I had to enable the ACS \"patch\"\n\n\n\n    pcie_acs_override=downstream\n\nBut since I am testing things, I believe it is worth trying. While this properly creates the IOMMU groups (I can use the SATA drives again) as expected, the physical network *enp4s* completely disappears from the command !\n\n`ip link`\n\nNo ping is possible, I cannot set anything in the network interface config. If I turn off IOMMU in BIOS, everything starts working again !\n\nI am slightly lost and I would really hope for some guidance on how to fix this issue. I am sure there is something possible as I can see the SATA properly used with the ACS patch.\n\nNB: Posted the same in Proxmox to have better visibility ",

    "title": "Looking for some advice on KVMs",
    "selftext": "Hi all!\n\nI'm looking into buying a KVM, and I think I could use some help. Essentially, I want a KVM for remotely reboot or power on my homeserver while I'm not at home. As well as to have the ability to see what's going on in case the server refuses to fully boot up for some reason. That is, I want a KVM for emergency remote access, nothing more. So, I don't need the latest in terms of latency or video streaming quality. The only other requirement I have is for it to not be a huge security hole.\n\nThe thing is that I'm struggling to find one with a reasonable price (I was thinking something around 100 $). JetKVM cannot be purchased yet, NanoKVM seems like a security liability and PiKVM is a bit expensive for my taste. DIY PiKVM may be an alternative, but I don't know if it's the kind of thing that you can have working in a couple of hours, or if more time is needed. Perhaps it's fine if I buy a second hand KVM from eBay?\n\nWhat are my options in that price range? Are my expectations out of touch with reality, as in, should I just accept that I need to spend more money to get a decent KVM?",

But does this server host stuff you can't live without until you're home & able to troubleshoot? And if it does, would it be possible to containerize it or virtualize it on the server?

Plenty of people here will say it's easy to set up, and that's probably true.  I just haven't had much luck with it myself.  So I defer to them.  \n\nOn the upside though.

You'll need your own domain name, have a firewall up and running configured suitably (ideally WAF but if not NAT and firewall rules) and have SSL certs sorted too.

    "title": "Modding your BIOS to unlock higher C-states on ASRock motherboards (Linux guide)",
    "selftext": "This is a follow up to the original guide posted here, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1998oh8/how_to_get_higher_pkg_cstates_on_asrock/ This guide got me going in the right direction but I ran into a few issues.\n\n- The AMISCE tool did not work. I downloaded it from Intel but both the Linux and Windows\nversions of the tool failed with \n\n> This tool is not supported on this system.\n> 49 - Error: A platform condition has prevented executing.\n\n- [setup_vars.efi](https://github.com/datasone/setup_var.efi) is another way of setting UEFI variables but it would complain that my platform was locked. This is also probably why AMISCE did not work.\n- I emailed ASRock to try and see if they would just send me a build of the BIOS with Low Power S0 enabled, and they told me it's not possible (I know, that's why I'm emailing you!) and that it's related to modern standby, not C-states (how do you think modern standby works?)\n\nFor reference, my platform is:\n\n- Intel i5 14600K\n- ASRock Z790M-ITX WiFi\n\nThis guide was written for ASRock but it should be fairly universal for those who can't use the easier methods. I obviously can't make any promises that this won't brick your board but I can at least offer that carefully following directions on UEFI Editor and flashprog helped me.\n\n---\n\n1. Dump the BIOS\n\n  It's possible that we could mod the BIOS directly from a downloaded file but I think it's a safer bet to start from what's actually on your machine first. On Linux (I'm using Debian), install [flashprog](https://flashprog.org/wiki/Flashprog), you'll likely need to build from source but you don't need any of the optional add ons. \n\n  With it built, run ```sudo flashprog --programmer internal --read dumped_bios.rom```\n\n  We can double check the dumped image with \n\n  ```sudo flashprog --programmer internal --verify dumped_bios.rom```\n\n  My dumped BIOS ROM was 16384 bytes, the exact same file size as a downloaded copy of it. This indicated it was 1-to-1 for me, but based on what I was reading in another guide, I'm less certain about things going well if your dump is larger than a downloaded copy of your BIOS.\n\n2. Mod the BIOS\n\n  Follow the guide and use the tool here to extract your BIOS image and load it in the online editor https://github.com/BoringBoredom/UEFI-Editor. \n\n  I don't know if this is the best way to do this, but here is what ended up working for me. I was attempting to swap the menu to allow access into the page that had the Low Power S0 option, but I ended up just stumbling into the hidden full list of menus, and I was able to access the necessary page from there.\n \n  1. Search for S0 Low Power\n\n      https://i.imgur.com/JSiWxxq.png\n\n      From here we can click into the form name and see the hidden settings page it's on. For me, that was on a page called `RC ACPI Settings` with form ID `0x2719`.\n\n  2. Swap a menu to it. I'm going to swap the OC Tweaker to the RC ACPI Settings page (it will still be possible to get OC Tweaker later). With the drop down open, it maybe be easiest to type the hex code in to find the option you're looking for.\n     \n     Before: https://i.imgur.com/rSCc2NX.png\n\n     After: https://i.imgur.com/Ks8HE6H.png\n\n  3. From here, export your files (it will likely only give you the AMITSE file, you only need to reinsert that) and continue the rest of the UEFI Editor guide to mod the changes back into your BIOS. I was a bit nervous using the older version of UEFI Editor but it still works at least with 14th gen it seems.\n\n3. Flash the BIOS back\n\n  You should now have the modded BIOS file. You can now flash that with flashprog. Do note that this carries all of the usual risks of flashing your BIOS, like power loss corrupting it, with the additional risks of it being modded. This part is really why we need flashprog, Instant Flash in the UEFI settings will refuse to flash your modded BIOS.\n\n  ```\n  sudo flashprog --programmer internal --write modded_bios.rom -V --progress\n  ```\n\n  flashprog will verify itself at the end of the flash but it also can't hurt to do it yourself.\n\n  ```sudo flashprog --programmer internal --verify modded_bios.rom```\n\n4. Getting into the right menu\n\n  With the BIOS flashed, reboot the computer and try to get into the UEFI settings. This is also the moment of truth for whether or not you bricked your motherboard.\n\n  For me, when I got into the advanced settings, I noticed that the OC Tweaker option was now missing. So I changed the setting to boot into the OC Tweaker menu when I opened the BIOS. Save and exit.\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/0I4jCmJ.png\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/1vcGvmr.png\n\n  From here, re-enter the BIOS once more, and you should see the OC Tweaker menu. But (at least for me), when I hit escape, I landed in the large list of hidden menus.\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/xl0qwSU.png\n\n  From here, I selected RC ACPI Settings page, went down to Low Power S0, and enabled it.\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/xl0qwSU.png\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/ygzdccu.png\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/iS1pKgv.png\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/A4tetha.png\n\n  It hung for a moment when I did this, wait it out. You'll know it's over when you can use the arrow keys to navigate up and down again (you might also have to hit escape sometimes).\n\n  From there, save and exit. You can load in once more to double check.\n\n  And this worked! I didn't end up getting C10 like the original guide but powertop shows some percentage at package C6 and my Shelly plug shows I shaved off about 5W at idle.\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/RnbCYB5.png\n\n  https://i.imgur.com/F4Byo1b.png\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions about how I could have better modded the menu or how to get further than C6, let me know.

Sorry you had to learn the hard way, but kudos for sharing your learnings with the rest of us.  \n  \nIn a job years ago we had to deploy a bunch of rack ATS units; in our testing (and in production...) we found that most units on the market behave quite poorly with out-of-sync sources because they can't get the relays to move fast enough to properly break before make (the requirement is 16ms). Many of them are even over-volting the relay coils to try to get the relays to move faster. The worst ones would arc-weld the relay contacts under high loads... not good.\n\nBetter devices use an SCR or similar solid state relay for the actual switching, in parallel with a mechanical relay (which is more energy efficient in steady state). This allows them to break/make connections safely in much shorter time windows without having the power draw of solid state relays under normal loads. This Delta unit is a good example: [https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/en/mcis/data-center-static-transfer-switch-series.php](https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/en/mcis/data-center-static-transfer-switch-series.php)\n\nFor homelab use, I've been happy with the CyberPower ATS PDUs, which don't have a requirement for phase alignment of input sources. My input phases are out of sync and it's always worked correctly.

Grounds are perfectly fine to bond against each other at any point (say you have device A, a computer, on L1, and device B, a TV, on L2 and you connect them via an HDMI cable, the shield will bond both devices' grounds) - their entire point is to have one common 0V reference. The only situation in which this can turn real messy is when the building's bonding is fucked somewhere and you got long cable runs - then equalization current can flow over cable shields. This is something that every stage technician and many a network installation person knows about, because many venues have shoddy electrics... if you see sparks from the shield while connecting long cable runs, time to call in the professionals before something catches fire. Yes, I've seen that happen.\n\nNeutrals are a different ballgame. These should never be bonded for the reason you mentioned on a device that can accept multiple mains inputs - that will kick off the GFCI(s) in the best case, in the worst case bonding two supposed neutrals can also lead to an outright short - in Europe, the commonly used Schuko plug can be plugged in either way around.",

    "selftext": "I've been using Pelican Game Servers for a while now to host servers for me and my friends. I usually keep the ones we’re using up and running, and shut down the others when they’re not needed. But when a server crashes or stops responding, someone always ends up asking me if it’s down or just restarting—and I have to check manually.\n\nI built this Discord bot to solve that problem. It automatically shows live, always-updating stats for all your game servers right in Discord. That way, anyone in your group can quickly see if a server is running, offline, or having issues—without needing to ping you or open the control panel.\n\nThe bot can be self-hosted on Pelican or a lightweight system, and I’ve included setup instructions to make it easy for others to get started. I'm continuing to expand its features, like message customization and more interactivity, so it can be even more useful over time.\n\nThis has been a passion project for me—it's something I made out of real need, and I hope it helps other people running game servers for their communities of friends, too.",

    "selftext": "I have been running my homelab (Lenovo SFF, OMV 6, 8 x 1TB drives, mergerfs, snapraid, rsnapshot, duplicati, syncthing, borg) now for over 4 years and I felt like it really sits there idle most of the time just using energy and wearing down. I mostly use it for backups and jellyfin. And since I maybe watch one movie per week I established the habit a few months ago of just having it switched off 6 days per week, then switch it on one day, copy files, do filesync, have it done the backups, etc - and then just switch it off again.\n\nI run 3 more free 24/7 online VPS for nextcloud, backups and syncing all my stuff, so it felt it actually does not need to on since I want to keep the wear on my HDDs as low as possible.\n\nWhat do you think? Valid strategy? Pros/cons?",

    "selftext": "Hey folks, sharing my recent project:\n\nI built a mini home server around a **Morefine M600 (Intel N100, 8GB RAM)** in a custom vertical case inspired by the Xbox Series X.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Intel N100, 8GB RAM\n* 512GB NVMe SSD for the OS\n* 2TB SSD for storage\n* Custom **3S2P lithium battery pack + BMS**, giving me \\~6–7 hours runtime on battery\n* Idle power draw around **6–8W**\n\n**Features:**\n\n* Runs Proxmox with Docker (Plex, AdGuard, Home Assistant)\n* Internal battery backup so it can handle outages without an external UPS\n* Big top fan and plenty of ventilation\n* Matte black panels and a clean front look to blend in with other gear\n\nPosting some photos so you can see how it turned out. It’s been rock-solid and sips power—super happy with it so far.\n\nHappy to answer questions!  \nOr maybe you have some idead \n\nPS: yes i know that wiring inside is sucks ",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nHope this post is OK as it's more of a technical question rather than showcasing actual hardware. Otherwise just delete it mods.\n\nI have a small homelab (just starting out) with a server running various services in docker and accessing them through cloudflare dns and nginx proxy manager.\n\nHowever when accessing the services the real ip of the device connecting to the service gets tampered through the route from internet -> cloudflare dns -> home router -> home server -> nginx proxy manager -> docker network -> service.\n\nI've searched quite a bit on the matter, but cannot find a clear explaination or guide to fix the problem.\n\nAs it stands my services are recieving an ip that corresponds the the nginx proxy manager docker container ip instead of the real visitor ip with npm also running on bridged docker network.\n\nIf I change npm container to run on host network the services are recieving my home server ip address instead of real client ip.\n\nIn my search I found varoius info about setting nginx proxy manager to forward the real visitor ip from cloudflare, but I could not get it working.\n\nThe reason this is an issue is because I'm running a service that has a defence mechanism that bans ip's that try to brute force entry. But if the ip the service sees is my npm docker ip then the npm docker ip gets banned by the service instead of the real offencer effectively cutting out all access to the service.\n\nHope you have some insights :)\n\nThanks",

    "selftext": "I made a 3D Printable Jonsbo hard drive sled that you can just snap on and use.\n\n[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7080915](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7080915)\n\nI have validated it with the N2 and N3 cases, but should work with any Jonsbo that uses the same type of rubber grommet mount design. Note that this does not offer any vibration dampening. I made it primarily so I could insert a drive into an empty bay to backup / transfer data as needed without having to scrounge for screws an grommets, etc.. Not sure it would hold up well over long periods.\n\nIt works by using nibs that snap into the screw holes. It secures it quite well.\n\nI did find the bracket was a bit looser on the WD drives, and a bit tighter on the Seagate drives. Also the sled was tight to fit into the N3, but loose in the N2. So some tolerances in the cases and drives may come into play.\n\nWhen printing, the only supports you'll need is for the cross support material above the SATA ports. Don't use supports for the nibs that snap into the screw holes as it may leave boogers that might keep it from snapping in.",

    "title": "Dell R730XD High Temp - Need help cooling servers",
    "selftext": "Hello Homelab Community,\n\nI probably have a common issue everyone probably deals with in their homelab. I have two Dell R730XD servers...one 24xSFF and one 12xLFF with 4 additional drive bay inside shelf. Both on 24U StarTek open server rack with two Cisco switch and a 1U shelf with a mini desktop and ATT laying on the shelf. At the bottom of the rack is an APC 3K 2U UPS. The rack is right under an AC vent in a corner wall away from two windows and I keep the room at 76 degrees. The rack is in my office on second floor loft about 400 sq ft where I work during the day. Note the loft has a dedicated AC unit. \n\nBoth Dell server processor report average temperature of 102F. Not good. So I was thinking of two things to do.\n\nSince I bought the servers last year, never thought I would need to, but might be a great idea to scrape the existing thermal paste and (after some research) apply new high thermal CPU paste. many recommend the Artic MX-4 Premium Performance Thermal Paste to help reduce high CPU heat. \nAmazon Link: https://a.co/d/bhOxgTI\n\nSecond thing to do is to help push AC inside and between the servers. Again, doing some research and many recommend the AC Infinity Cloudplate Intake Rack Mount Fan Panel. \nAmazon Link: https://a.co/d/j2HPbzc\nI thought of getting two units. Each on top part of the respective Dell server to help push AC air through the rack to help cool the servers. It also might help if I placed another AC infinity intake fan on top of the UPS unit. \n\nSince I have an open rack and right below the AC vent, I don't think having a top rack intake fan would be needed. \n\nAny thoughts, other ideas, or suggestions on helping to keep the servers slightly cool the best I can. I appreciate the guidance everyone. ",

I would like to make the goal of trying to keep the servers under 122F ~50C, which I believe is very durable. \n\nMy first plan is to definitely get both Dell servers repasted. I am sure that will help a bit.\n\nSecond plan (my new idea) is to place/move the Dell R730XD 12LFF + 4LFF mid-bay server to the top of the rack so the AC would help cool it first and see if that helps a small bit. But I will continue to run the servers at their current output temperatures. \n\nFor now, I will hold off on getting the AC Infinity Cloudplate Rack Mount Fan Panel. \n\nAgain, thanks everyone in the community for your input.",

It really depends on your workload I think.\n\nI run a 6 node ceph cluster, 5 nodes have 2xSSDs. Samsung PM983s. 9 are 4TB m.2 and one is a 8TB m.3. It runs well and handles VMs no problem. Network is 2x10Gbe bonded together LACP. I can get over 22000 IOPS using fio with 4k random writes. Consumer SSDs might cut this by 100x. Drives with PLP let applications like database and many VM methods to report a successful write to disk once it's in cache because of PLP. Consumer drives can take far longer to actually write to disk. If you plan on running VMs on it, I'd probably suggest using drives with PLP. Even a 2.5\" over a nvme without it.\n\nBenchmarking at small 4k writes, network bandwidth is only about 110MiB/s. Large sequential writes get me up to 1600MiB/s+. 10gbe network bandwidth might be a less important than lower latency drives from how you sound like you want to use it.  I'll add that write speed increased from 3 to 4 to 5 nodes quite a bit for both large and small writes. \n\nCompared to a single PM983, it seems like my large sequence writes are about equal or a bit higher than a single drive. I haven't gone back to benchmark it and compare. IOPS is less than half a single drive by itself.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Lenovo m920q is the fact it's m.2 slot is only 2280. There isn't a large selection of drives in that form factor with PLP. You might be able to use the wifi slot for storage as a boot drive or as a 2.5gbe network. I'm not sure if you could find a 5Gbe or faster adapter.",

The fact it's doing reasonably sized sequential reads while hitting random i/o for torrents and thumping the cpu makes it less than ideal. It does keep up, but struggles and becomes unbelievably slow.\nTranscoding 4k is also touch and go.\nI will keep all my media on the spinning drives.\n\nThe idea behind ceph is not so much for the storage but the distributed storage across a cluster. I'm planning on setting up proxmox and running all my containers on the nodes. I can store my incoming directory, plex db, and transcode dir either in a VM (maybe dynamic?) But probably not ideal, or in a flash smb store somewhere or maybe ceph which will distribute it across all nodes. I won't need more than a or 2tb total. Even that much is just being un necessarily greedy. Basically it will be an operational drive rather than storage and have no crucial or unreplacable files.\n\nI realize there's much easier, cheaper, and conventional ways to do this.

I use it with an adapter for a boot drive. \n\nAs far as mismatched drives, I don't think it's a big deal unless it's massive. The default crush rules would give a drive with twice the capacity twice the weight (so more would be stored on it), but I'm 99% sure you can go in and modify that to spread data evenly even if the drive isn't as fully used as the others. \n\nCeph is as slow as your slowest drive. So I wouldn't mix SSDs and disks, especially enterprise SSDs with PLP.  But you can create different crush rules, one for your fastest storage (nvme), one for non-nvme ssds if you wand and one for spinning disks.  Of course you can mix types too. It wouldn't be uncommon to have VMs running on the SSDs and media on spinning disks if you wanted. 3 replicas isn't really space efficient though and going lower is a bit risky. ZFS in a NAS would probably give you more usable storage out of x raw storage. \n\nMore nodes aren't exponential, but it increases, but probably more like diminishing returns. Each adds a set amount until you reach a different bottleneck. I'd build it with what you have and see what you want you may need later. The overall speed may get a bit higher, but you are dealing with networks here, it's not going to compete with a mirror unless you have major equipment. Consider a modern SSD can get 7-14GB/s transfer rate. A 10gbe network is (roughly) 1GB/s. You'd need 100gbe networks to get to that level. Now, if you have 10+ nodes at 10gbe, connected to a switch with a 100gbe uplink. The computer connected to it had native ceph client support it could pull from all the servers at once and maybe get up there. I'm not exactly sure how writes work in that situation. \n\nEven with dual 10gbe adapters, you'll get 2GB/s max, far below current SSDs, and LACP doesn't just double your bandwidth, you are still limited to 10gbe for a single connection. \n\nLatency... I'm not 100% sure on this. Yes, more OSDs I think will help with latency. More PGs, you can write to more drives at once, but only in the sense that you were bottlenecked by it before. Just adding more isn't going to make latency better. You still have network latency and all replicas need to report written before ceph moves on. \n\nHere is raw output from fio 4k running my 5 nodes, 10xNVME PM983 SSDs, 10gbe bond over LACP 3+4. If you notice it's only maxing at 110MB/s, 1/10th of even a single 10gbe connection. If you are dealing with VMs and small writes the network isn't going to be a big problem, but PLP will help you far more. There may be some latency difference between 1gbe, 2.5gbe and 10gbe networks.  (not sure), but it's probably minor with these small writes. Unless you are writing gigabytes at a time and maxing out your network, you might not notice the difference with slower networks.  Live migration maybe, if the memory usage is high?",

Will ask more questions about those another time lol.\n\nAssuming both cases have appropriate ventilation, drive space, etc, what are other considerations that should be made before switching? Is it even worth the switch? Are racks really worth the hype?

A simple google search would throw you with several post and reviews of the Beelink SER9 using 7-9W of the wall. Meanwhile, I have had a mini pc with a N100 that never went single digit and a simple google search would throw you a lot of reviews of different models of mini PCs with similar numbers. There are probably some model with a better PSU or better components that could reach single digits, but if that's the case, it's still in the same range of the HX370.   \n  \nIn any case, the yearly cost of 1-2W difference is irrelevant in any scenario.

All processors draw more power when you demand more from them\n\nYeah, but also consider how much performance you get out of that energy. If you're getting more done in less time, you would end up saving energy.\n\nFor example, for anything that require high power, the N100 would definitely consume more power since it would need to be at 100% for way more time, while the HX370 could probably finish the task in minutes if not seconds. Like, 1 minute consuming 60W for a task vs 7 minutes at 15W. The N100 is 7 times slower than the HX370, so it should take 7x more for the same heavy task.\n\n>Depending on the test, lunar lake has exceeded SDx in terms of battery life, and certainly has it beat in power\n\nExactly the same as the previous part... people are buying high end CPUs for the extra performance so they could do mixed tasks. There is no point of having something ultra efficient only for light tasks. Regular users would do all kind of tasks and all their cores would be active at some point, defeating the whole power savings while doing light tasks if their performance ones are not efficient whatsoever consuming way more when needed.\n\n>Not particularly, no. Battery life correlates with battery size and the power draw of every component in the laptop.

The power consumption could be easily extrapolated based on the battery size (Wh) and how much it lasted. You usually get a very close value with similar systems, so you could easily get an statistical value of their power consumption... doesn't matter if its connected to the wall or a battery, at the end of the day, both are using energy and could be compared.

In which case the n100 is infinitely better than the hx given quick sync support\n\nI assure you that this NAS is not designed as a pure NAS, but a whole homelab replacement. If you want a simple NAS, just get a cheap Synology or WD cloud. There is no point of having a full PCIe port, oculink, support for U2 SSD, or a CPU that powerful... I have read more than 1 person talking about replacing their VM machines and using only this.\n\nAnd about plex/jellyfin, newer AMD GPUs support hardware acceleration. People are so fixated on the old AMD GPUs and their h264 transcoding. The 980m supports VCN (AV1) and it can easily handle 10 simultaneous remux 4k to 1080p transcodes. Yeah, quicksync is in theory better, but the video quality difference is not even noticeable unless you have a side by side comparison and you're actively looking for those differences. The Av1 transcode of AMD is already in a point that could be called \"more than good enough\". Just don't get an old APU.\n\n>This is all nonsense. This is a NAS solution, not a workstation\n\nAgain, this kind of hardware is not mean as a simple NAS, but a whole VM homelab replacement. If you only want a simple NAS/Plex, then there are hundred of cheaper solutions and easier to config, but none of those would be able to actually run heavier stuff like a voice-assisted home assistant, a game server, or databases for developers... not even the AI file search engine that was one of the main selling points of this NAS.\n\n>The peripherals and accessories attached to the motherboard of a laptop have a massive impact on battery life. there are no \"similar systems\" here.\n\nHave you ever had an statistic class? Every single component could be isolated and the overall energy of of component extrapolated. If 2 laptops have all the same components but a different CPU (you could easily find this in multiple laptops from the same manufacturer), it's pretty easy to know the CPU power consumption difference. Also, the whole laptop argument was about how across every laptop, the HX370 is on top of the efficiency chart. Lots of those laptop's CPUs are on mini PCs too with known wall consumption.",

    "selftext": "Hey gang, fairly technical fellow but Nas noob here. After having a couple drives crap out on me in the last year, im finally trying to get my act together with backing things up. I want to go the DIY Nas route because I like tinkering and I have an old PC from my parents that I grabbed while visiting them to start with. The only real purpose i need it for is backing up my many external hard drives mostly consisting of videos so i can organize from my Mac. I have a gameplan laid out here that i would love feedback on to see if im overlooking things or if there are better options\n\nThe specs are:\n\nATI Radeon 102b2760701 PCIe graphics card \n2x Samsung RAM  m378T2863DZS 1GB (will be replacing and upgrading to 8gb)\nIntel core 2 duo e8200 \n\nI’m thinking ill just use truenas since its free and im trying to keep this low budget. Planning to grab some cheap 32gb 2.5” Sata SSD on eBay for boot drive and then occupy the rest with refurbished server 8tb hard drives mirrored two at a time and adding more over time as needed. The CPU does not have integrated graphics and the graphics card is ATI which doesn’t even exist anymore, but browsing forums it seems like it should still work fine with this os, truenas just works fine with whatever default gpu driver from my understanding? I just need it for setup anyway then plan to use it headless. The CPU does not support ECC but I use checksum software for transfers so im not super concerned about that. im also looking into carbon copy cloner for my Mac as an automated way to back up whatever I haven’t put on the Nas yet. \n\nAny advice and recommendations appreciated, hoping to get as much right from the start as I can before purchasing!

They do not recommend it, particularly if you store .sparseimage files. TrueNAS has settings to format a drive to work with backups like Time Machine, but I don't trust it yet.",

If retaining VM IPs during migration isn't a strict requirement, then simply having the hosts connected via WireGuard and manually changing the VM's network bridge on migration (so it gets a new IP from the destination subnet) is a simpler approach.",

They were fair and reasonable in price imo. Now, it is $180 for one. The worst part is that it is sold out.\n\nI was able to find a very small guy that was selling 18tb drives for \\~$120 a pop with $10 shipping. That was fair and reasonable. Now, 6 months later he is always sold out and bumped up his prices by $30.\n\nAs a broke college kid, I feel priced out of the market. I am not paying \\~$180 for a 12TB or \\~$200 for 18TB on Ebay. It just feels weird that it jumped up so much.\n\nI guess I might as well throw it out there like I did 6 months ago. Why do you think hard drive prices are high up?

Now even moderately large storage requirements can be handled by flash based storage, easily and cheaply.  Slowly mechanical hdd is getting painted into a niche usage market segment, which is going to drive up its cost, because it isn't selling the quantity it use too. The sad part is this niche market doesn't really care about overall performance but archival density.

That's something that's likely slowed down a lot in the past year meaning fewer used enterprise drives on the market. Lower supply + same demand = higher prices.

I do some basic backup using Syncthing and also mount a windows network drive on it. I run Plex off it to stream one show I get from overseas.\n\nI also have a old Chromebox that has been repurposed as a dedicated home assistant box that has a usb zwave/zigbee stick. \n\nI am running into a few issues. \n\n* Plex is starting to charge for remote streaming of my own stuff. I literally only use it for one show so I would like to migrate to JellyFin. Jellyfin doesnt work on TrueNAS core.\n* Home Assistant runs okay but sometimes it hangs for no reason and has to be rebooted.\n\nI need to move off TrueNAS core and move to something else. I was contemplating moving to TrueNAS scale. But lately I have been thinking that TrueNAS is a little overkill for what I use it for. I also would like to run JellyFin, maybe a VPN setup for remote access to my network, and move Home Assistant to the main server. I might also want to spin up some other things in the future such as Obico and Spoolman for my 3d printers.\n\nI was thinking maybe ProxMox might be a good solution? Any other thoughts?",

    "title": "How a rookie mistake led me down a network troubleshooting rabbit hole, and reminded me how important subnetting is",
    "selftext": "Over the weekend, I installed Pi-hole on a Raspberry Pi Zero to act as a DNS-based ad blocker for my home network. It was working perfectly for devices connected to my LAN, blocking known ad/tracker domains as expected.\n\nBut I wanted that same protection when I’m away from home. My router supports OpenVPN, so I set that up to tunnel traffic back through the LAN. The VPN tunnel came up cleanly, and the client was assigned an IP in the [10.8.0.0/24](http://10.8.0.0/24) range.\n\nThe goal was to have all DNS traffic from the VPN client routed through Pi-hole (10.0.0.2). But it wasn’t working.\n\nInitial symptoms:\n\n✅ VPN tunnel working — client got 10.8.x.x address\n\n✅ Could ping other devices on the LAN (like 10.0.0.4)\n\n❌ Could not ping [10.0.0.2](http://10.0.0.2) (Pi-hole) or SSH to it over the VPN.\n\n❌ DNS resolution bypassing the pi-hole\n\nI SSH'd to a different client behind the VPN and used that to SSH to the Pi-hole and ran some Initial checks:\n\n`netstat -tuln`showed Pi-hole was listening on port 53\n\n`tcpdump -i any port 53 and host` [`10.8.0.6`](http://10.8.0.6) confirmed DNS queries were hitting the Pi-hole\n\nBut the VPN client never got a response.\n\nThe (stupidly simple) mistake:\n\nI had manually assigned a static IP to the Pi-hole using NetworkManager, but I didn’t specify the subnet so it defaulted to a /8. That meant the Pi-hole believed everything in 10.x.x.x was on the local LAN.\n\nSo when it received a DNS query from a VPN client (10.8.0.6), it tried to respond directly instead of routing back through the tunnel.\n\nEven worse: I had made the same mistake on both eth0 and wlan0.\n\nComplicating issues, I was working remotely in a coffee shop and trying to fix this over the VPN connection.\n\nFortunately, I had left Wi-Fi active on the Pi-hole specifically for backup access if I ever messed up the wired config.\n\nHere’s what I did:\n\nUsed `nmcli` to reconfigure both interfaces to use /24 subnets:\n\n`nmcli con modify \"Wired connection 1\" ipv4.addresses` [`10.0.0.2/24`](http://10.0.0.2/24)  \n`nmcli con modify \"Wired connection 1\" ipv4.gateway` [`10.0.0.1`](http://10.0.0.1)  \n`nmcli con modify \"Wired connection 1\" ipv4.method manual`  \n  \nBut I had to bring the interface down and back up again to apply the change.\n\nI ran:\n\n`nmcli con down \"Wired connection 1\" && nmcli con up \"Wired connection 1\"`  \n  \nAs I feared, I lost connection over eth0, but I was able to re-connect on the WiFi interface so I was able to bring eth0 back up and then do the same for the Wireless interface.\n\nVerified routing table:\n\n`ip route` and confirmed both interfaces had correct /24 netmasks.\n\nOk, cool.  Now I can ping the Pi-hole box and SSH to it directly instead of jumping through a different host.\n\nBut how to get my VPN client (a Windows machine) to use the Pi-hole as a DNS server?  Unfortunately, the OpenVPN implementation on my router doesn't let me specify a DNS server address for clients.\n\nThe solution: Manually edit the .ovpn config file to include:  \n  \n`dhcp-option DNS` [`10.0.0.2`](http://10.0.0.2) Then re-imported the config and reconnected.\n\nThe client was now sending queries to the right IP , but they were STILL timing out.\n\nFinal fix:\n\nTurns out, by default, Pi-hole only responds to DNS queries from clients within its own subnet.\n\nTo allow it to respond to VPN clients in the [10.8.0.0/24](http://10.8.0.0/24) range, I had to go into the Pi-hole web UI and change:\n\nSettings > DNS > Interface settings → Set to \"Respond only on interface eth0\"\n\nOnce that was applied:  \n  \n✅ DNS resolution over VPN worked  \n✅ Ad blocking worked  \n✅ Logging in Pi-hole confirmed the VPN client was sending all queries through it\n\nLessons learned:\n\nAlways specify the subnet when setting a static IP.\n\nMisconfigured subnets don’t always cause total failure, sometimes they fail just enough to waste hours.\n\nHaving a backup access method (like Wi-Fi) when working remotely is essential!",

Then, you run tmux. You can open multiple screens and even panes (subscreens). You run your favorite editor inside a screen and have subshells within that, if supported. For example, I’m a big emacs fan and will run a shell inside eMacs in a tmux window.\n\nThen, if you walk away from your laptop or close it or whatever and the ssh session disconnects, everything is still running and waiting for you in the tmux session on the remote computer.\n\nYou just ssh in again and reattach. I forget the exact command, something like `tmux a -u 0` or such. Boom. You’re reattached and everything is still active.\n\nVery simple command set.

I suspect that the connection to the front was the issue as it's a little loose--but I just won't breathe and it should be fine!\n\nI'm brand new to the rack game and got an R730XD in great condition. I have the RAID controller set to HBA mode and my OS is able to see all of the front panel drives with no problem (all SATA). However, I have a 1TB SSD SATA drive that is not being recognized on the back plane. Both lights on the caddy light up and I've confirmed that it's seated, but it's not being recognized by either the lifecycle controller or in the OS.\n\nThere are no errors in the startup that would indicate a problem that I can see, and I've confirmed that the controller is firmly attached and connected to the front plane (see images).\n\nAny ideas on what I might be doing wrong?

Noctua CPU cooler + fans or similar. Barely hearable at 600rpm\n\nWhen you want 4TB NVMe storage -> use 2 4tb NVMe in Mirror / Raid1 instead of 3 with Raid 5. Speed will be the same or even better.\n\nHDD why Raid10 with 4x12Tb when you can go Mirror with 2x24TB and extend this later with an additional 2x24TB Mirror?  \nFor Speed improvement you can add some SSD cache in front. I use LVM Cache. You can just use a part of your 4TB NVMe ...\n\nApeshit crazy way:  \n\\- 16+ Core Epyc  \n\\- ECC Memory, 128 PCIe Lanes  \n\\- you can expand like crazy ...\n\nReasonable way:  \n\\- use am5 plattform  \n\\-- maybe limit TDP of CPU to 65W or so ... performance hit is lesser than expected  \n\\- I would already go for 2x48/64GB Memory  \n\\- just stick to 1 GPU, having 2 only for AI ... lesser PCIe Lanes should be sufficient  \n\\-- but having to move 2x300+W out of the case will be noticeable  \n\\-- you likely wont be able to fit 2 gaming 3+ slot wide GPUs in a case  \n\\-- \"AI\" blower style GPUs are loud as hell (having 2x 4090 blower in one rig full of Noctua Industrial 3k rpm fans in a AC room at 20°C and they are still loud as hell)  \n\\-- PSU with 1300W might be overkill in this case\n\nThe GPU will likely be the loudest part of the build.  \nSo when AiO you might use one for the GPU instead of CPU.",

A few weeks ago, I started getting alerts from IPMI that \"PS2\" is flapping - going from \"Power Supply Failure Detected - Asserted\" to \"Power Supply Failure Detected - Deasserted\" with the \"failure\" lasting anywhere between a few seconds to a few minutes.\n\nHowever, a physical inspection of both power supplies doesn't seem to indicate a problem with either. The green LED on each is lit and steady and fans are operational on both. TBH I'd prefer just to figure out which power supply is flapping and simply replace it, but I can't tell which one is PS2 and which one is PS1. I've reviewed the chassis and mobo manuals but neither has any reference to either PS1 or PS2.\n\nIs there a simple way to figure out which is which? Or should I just get a new PSU and try replacing one then the other to see which results in the IPMI errors going way?",

That provides some connections for things downstairs and my main computer, daily driver.\n\nThe port  ix2 it goes to a other switch which is 2.5gb and then an sfp 10gb connection goes to the p920.\n\nI believe my best course id action is to pass through the att router.\n\nThen instead of 1:1 NAT, open specific ports as needed on the p920?\n\nAny advice on a better way to do this?  Guides that people recommend or might be helpful.  I'm not a complete novice but I'm also not excited about most of this.  Like this isn't oh, so much fun. It's something I have to do.\n\nFor those wondering the datacenter I co locate in currently is fantastic but they aren't keen on hosting a device that uses that many amps and while they would probably work with me to find a solution, it's also a 4 hour drive if I ever need to go there any reason.\n\nAny advice or suggestions are appreciated.\n\nI am for the record aware this is probably a bad idea but I have 16 hours of battery backup, and we have home generators that I can startup of need more time than that.\n\nThis is also strictly a hobby. Though I don't have a problem making a purchase if it makes sense.\n\nAgain I am grateful for any words of wisdom, advice or pointers.",

I've been gathering some information about it, but I would like to know some tips about which PCs you would recommend me and other components you've found useful the first time you've built something similar. My idea us build a 2-3 nodes cluster (maybe in a rack for mini PCs but this is optional, first thing is purchase the PCs). I wouldn't like to spend a lot on it because it will.be more like a playground, and if I have the option I will buy second hand computers. I'm platform engineer and the purpose of building this cluster is to test some tools, investigate about some services and that kind of stuff. I don't have in mind deploy services that I will use in my day to day by now. Thank you beforehand!!",

    "selftext": "**TLDR: How do you connect cloud compute (VPC) to your local network in the context of docker and reverse proxying? I only want to run a reverse proxy and VPN on the VPC with all docker resources on my local net.**\n\nI run a moderately sized homelab of 9 nodes and use [docker overlay networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/tutorials/overlay/), with all nodes joined to a swarm, to keep networking transparent. There are other benefits of doing this like network isolation, easier iptables enforcement, and service discovery (auto dns for containers).\n\nI've recently purchased a VPC and want to connect it into my existing swarm and overlay networks. I've successfully setup [Netbird](https://netbird.io/) and have basic connectivity working on a host level IE can connect to docker containers via VPC ***host***:port using bridge networking with WG IP but am struggling with getting it working as a worker node in swarm and joining overlay networks (UDP issues). My research leads me to believe this is due to VXLAN (overlay) packet overhead combined with wireguard overhead and MTU settings for docker ingress/overlay interfaces. I've been tinkering with it but obviously its still not working.\n\nPangolin doesn't seem like the answer since it also uses wireguard and doesn't seem to be designed to be used as transparently (wants you to use it solely for reverse proxy). I also haven't found any information about using it with overlay networks so that seems like a deadend as well (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nNow, I'm trying to take a step back now and figuring *surely* other people here have this scenario, but searching posts hasn't turned up much helpful advice. Should I be looking into IPSec/strongSwan? Flannel? Some other way to configure docker network drivers?",

    "selftext": "TL;DR  \nNeed advice to minimise wear on zfs pool from qbittorent's constant incremental writes. Advice on how to avoid issues with arr stack if a separate download location for qbittorrent is reccomended\n\nHomelab noob\n\nI’m in the midst of setting up my arr/qbitorrent/gluetun stack via docker on an ubuntu vm (on proxmox host)  \n  \nMedia/bulk storage will end up in an HDD zfs pool (RAIDZ1)  \nVM root drive is an NVME (LVM-thin, same drive stores other lxc/vm drives for the other stuff on proxmox).  \n  \nI have read all through as many recent posts as I could come across here and in other relevant subreddits,  but I guess I’m still too inexperienced to properly understand.  \nI would appreciate some clarification  \n\n\n1. In the interest of avoiding fragmentation and wear on the HDD zfs pool, and not having that hdd head jumping all-around etc\n   * would it be advisable to have the temporary (incomplete torrent) download location on the root drive (nvme) and then have the arr stack move it to the zfs pool in one go after?\n   * Or maybe it is even better to add a new SSD (WD Red 500) and pass that into the vm and have it download into there, so it’ll take up all the wear, and be easily swapable? rather than adding wear to the vm/lxc storage nvme\n   * Any settings on the zfs pool that is passed through, currently only have discard on (if I read correctly, noatime is to be avoided for ZFS HDD?)\n   * Any setting in qbitorrent to assist in all of this endeavor? \n2. As per the [sonar/radar pages for docker:](https://sonarr.tv/#downloads-docker)\n\n>*Avoid common pitfalls*\n\n>*Volumes and Paths*\n\n>*There are two common problems with Docker volumes: Paths that differ between the Sonarr and download client container and paths that prevent fast moves and hard links.*\n\n>*The first is a problem because the download client will report a download's path as /torrents/My.Show.S01E01/, but in the Sonarr container that might be at /downloads/My.Show.S01E01/. The second is a performance issue and causes problems for seeding torrents. Both problems can be solved with well planned, consistent paths*\n\n>*Most Docker images suggest paths like /tv and /downloads. This causes slow moves and doesn't allow hard links because they are considered two different file systems inside the container. Some also recommend paths for the download client container that are different from the Sonarr container, like /torrents.*\n\n>*The best solution is to use a single, common volume inside the containers, such as /data. Your Series would be in /data/tv, torrents in /data/downloads/torrents and/or usenet downloads in /data/downloads/usenet.*\n\nDoes this mean if I were to implement a separate download location/drive, that I would then have issues?\n\nthe logic being that if I had a separate download location it would look something like:\n\n    /tank/media:/tank/media #tank being the hdd zfs pool\n    /ssd/qbitorrent/downloads/:downloads #ssd being the separate WD Red ssd\n\nI have tried to go through this TRaSH guid [here ](https://trash-guides.info/File-and-Folder-Structure/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/#what-are-hardlinks)But I am not sure if it is what I would need to implement, and how.  \n  \nIf someone could break it down into more digestible info for me that would help get my head on right for this",

You can easily deploy it in your k3s cluster, expose it via Traefik on a subdomain, and then point all your nodes DNS to it so they rely on AdGuard for filtering. It has a simple web interface, works great with Docker or Kubernetes, and also provides an API if you ever want to manage filtering rules from something like Grafana or Gitea.\n\nAs for the smallest Ollama model that can run on a Raspberry Pi 4 cluster, you’ll be limited by RAM and CPU. A very small quantized model like TinyLlama, around 1.1 billion parameters, or a minimal variant of Phi-2 is about the most you can expect to handle. Even then, inference will be slow, but it should be usable for small testing purposes. Anything larger will most likely not run at all on a Pi 4.\n\nIn short, AdGuard Home should reliably handle your DNS filtering when combined with Traefik, and if you want to experiment with Ollama on a Pi 4, you’ll need to stick to the tiniest models to have even halfway decent performance.",

That's why the company that's selling you these non-custom racks is using it.\n\n> Do others build it the same\n\nAny soundproof rack that doesn't cost a fortune is going to be a variation on that theme, yes.\n\n> make it look decent?\n\nYou can make foam and wood look decent, for some definitions of \"decent\".\n\n> What material works best for server noise?\n\nSound is just vibrations, which then vibrate the air and the air reaches your ears. The way to reduce what reaches your ears is to use materials that deaden vibrations, which generally means they're soft. Foams, rubber, etc. are generally used because they're easy to work with and deaden vibrations.\n\n> Is there material that's sound proof but not airtight?\n\nSee above answer for why this wouldn't work.",

Anything with a MediaTek CPU typically has great support with openWRT which is nice to have if the router stops getting updates from its company or if you want more functionality from the router\n\nBoth should be able to be powered by a power bank (typically you are allowed a small battery power bank on planes)\n\nHope that helps",

    "title": "[Build Help] Planning a DIY NAS for Jellyfin & Data Storage – Feedback Wanted",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I'm planning to build my first DIY NAS and would love some feedback and advice on the parts I've selected. My goals for the NAS are:\n\nLong-term data storage (40–60 TB to start, expandable in the future)\n\n10–15 users streaming via Jellyfin (possibly simultaneously)\n\nAbility to upgrade later (more storage, maybe a GPU)\n\nQuiet, reliable, and 24/7 operation\n\nBudget: ~$2000–$2500 USD including storage (flexible if it’s worth it)\n\nI’m going the DIY route instead of a prebuilt NAS for more flexibility and upgradability.\n\nCurrent Planned Build:\nCase: Fractal Design Define R5\n\nCPU: Intel Core i7-13700\n\nMotherboard: ASRock Z790 PRO\n\nRAM: 64 GB (2×32 GB DDR5 — undecided on exact model)\n\nStorage: Seagate IronWolf Pro (starting with 40–60 TB total)\n\nPSU: Corsair RM850e or RM650e (leaning toward RM850e for future GPU)\n\nCPU Cooler: Noctua NH-D15\n\nOS: Planning to use TrueNAS SCALE\n\nIs the i7-13700 overkill for a NAS? I know many builds use i5 or even i3, but I figured the extra cores would help with multiple simultaneous Jellyfin transcodes.\n\nMotherboard choice: I picked the ASRock Z790 PRO after seeing it in Reddit builds. Is it a good match for my goals?\n\nRAM confusion: ECC vs non-ECC, DDR4 vs DDR5 — what’s best for a TrueNAS setup like this? Any reliable DDR5 64GB kits you’d recommend?\n\nStorage: Sticking with IronWolf Pro for now, but curious how they compare to WD Red, Exos, or Toshiba N300 long-term.\n\nPSU: Would 650W be enough or should I future-proof with 850W? Planning to possibly add a GPU for transcoding later.\n\nGeneral build advice: This is my first PC/NAS build — anything you’d change, simplify, or add?\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions! I’m open to tweaking the build and learning from your experience.",

Don’t waste money on T version, get any version which has iGPU\n2.\tMotherboard while z790 is great, it could be overkill and depending on particular model -> might be not as flexible. I suggest to look into AsRock Steel series\n3.\tYou really don’t need DDR5, but if you go high end board - get DDR5\n4.\tI wouldn’t go “e” series for Corsair and just get “x” if you can. x is much more quiet, RM750x is probably overkill but great\n5.\tIronWolfs are fine, but I wouldn’t aim them. Suggestion will be Toshiba MG series, or WD ULTRASTAR HC. With this case you wouldn’t even notice these drives spinning, I have define 7 in living room, never heard drives. (but I also have 15tb ssd cache, as tiered storage setup). Also, noise wise they should be similar but enterprise grade\n6.\tNow, 10-15 users streaming makes no difference as long as they are not transcoding. if they need transcoding, how many of them you expect simultaneous and which type of transcoding (4k->1080p, or 1080p->.., tone mapping or not?)?\n\n\nI think point 6 is the most important missing bit, with lack of intel PCIE lanes you need to plan a bit more in advance",

It will generally not affect idle power consumption much compared to the i5 or i3.\n\n> And is ECC RAM necessary.\n\nFor a casual homelab generally not. ~~But it would probably fit in the budget.

Thinking of getting the RM750x.\n\nSince this Server will probably run 24/7, consider spending a bit more money for a higher efficiency PSU (Titanium or Platinum)\n\n> I am probably gonna use transcoding most of the time from 4K to 1080. Not sure how many are gonna be transcoding.\n\nI'd set it up without a GPU first and see if you actually hit any limits. If you do, buy an Intel Arc graphics card (A310, A380 or A40), those will generally give you the best bang per buck if you just want transcoding (<200$).",

I am not sure on content restrictions, i think it's going to vary by models / providers. I don't do much that would be caught in that kind of stuff. But if you want to occasionally send a couple messages back and forth, it's often fairly cheap per token. Kinda fits most of my needs, but it has been a while.\n\nRunpod- you are renting GPUs by the hour. There's some minor costs for bandwidth, storage, but last i looked it was really cheap (like under 2usd a month when not in use). Then if you need to rent GPUs, you pay for the GPU's while in use. In this situation, you would have full control, unlimited settings- and be paying so much an hour- I think 2-6 dollars depending on your need, if you want reserved or 'demand ' type access, security, etc.\n\nSo in the runpod scenario, if you only really spend 5 hours a week working with LLMs, but know you'll send hundreds of messages in that session?  You can probably get by with something like  15 buck if you remember to turn everything off when you are done.\n\nIf you're savvy enough you can build it out programmatically, so it starts a -per second runpod instance when you are running the program, and turns it off when you are not- but me, personally, don't trust myself as a coder when it comes to paying billable time.\n\nAnyway, either way you shake it- unless you absolutely need that 24/7 or cheaper parts around.. (or another use for that kind of rig. I do still run nicer graphics cards then I strictly need for non-llm purposes., it's probably going to take a long time for a thousand dollar investment in running local LLMs to pay off comparably.\n\nand in the meantime, hopefully some day we have cheaper hardware availible.

        "body": "DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 require much more expensive PCBs. Compute per joule is not really getting better anymore; everything is just built with more expensive parts to get density up higher. Cost is not going to come down until we collectively decide we're okay with lower bus speeds.\n\n(rant)\n\nMoore's Law isn't dead, but keeping it going has a dark downside: eventually, every cost equation becomes quadratic. The power requirements to send a signal increase with the square of distance; that's been true forever. Power requirements to go faster are quadratic now; that's a relatively recent development. Cost requirements are starting to get the same way.\n\nWe're halfway through 2025 and still, no one has demonstrated a working PCIe 6.0 connector. It can go across a board, it can go through a cable, but an edge connector just introduces too much noise. One could increase the voltage but power consumption increases with the square of voltage. Active correction? Power usage increases with the square of everything you do. One could use larger waveguides but (say it with me this time) power consumption increases with the square of the size of the waveguide.\n\nReally, Mellanox figured it out over a decade ago: the optimal speed is 14gbps. Sending data faster than that is never going to be worth the added power or board cost. (So why do they go faster? Money, of course.) Under the hood, an NVlink switch is really a fridge-sized crossbar made of 14gbps links using the same PHYs and lasers as FDR-generation InfiniBand / 56 gigabit Ethernet. You can't go faster without adding FEC support. It's not worth the cost and it's not worth the electricity.\n\nWhat would really serve the market best is a set of protocols that all agree on speed and encoding again. PCIe 3.2, SATA 4.0, and 14 gigabit Ethernet. Chip, board, and power costs would become reasonable again. It's fast enough for 4k gaming. It's fast enough for serving websites.",

Sure the newer chips are technically more power efficient under load, but most of the idle usage is in the I/O complex. The only \"real\" upgrade would be EPYC Sienna, the ZEN4c, 6-channel plattform with a smaller socket, but still lots of PCIe lanes optimized for lower power usage.\n\nThe biggest argument against 7001 is probably single threaded performance (and maybe AVX256 throughput), but that's rarely an issue in a homelab.\n\nSo if you're just after many PCIe lanes saving 600$+ on the initial purchase of CPU+Mainboard and accepting a 10W-30W power delta might be worth it. Even at 33ct/kWh and 20W more that's like 60$/year, so the \"break even\" point would be in a decade.",

Take some of the programs that the main PC does and put them on their own PC with the environment more configured to the task\n\ntwo workstations then start to want a proper router and network storage: which imo are a good start to a homelab but better done on SBCs or mini-pcs initially. Once there is network storage and DNS and media server and logging server and network monitoring and some other things then an old gaming pc might be more useful hosting VMs",

A nearby strike sent a surge down the cable line, frying the cable company's equipment on the pole, the modem, the pictured switch, and several servers. The damage seemed fairly random; some never POSTed again, some can only use 100m ethernet now, one switch escaped entirely unscathed while another has a POE port that no longer provides power (but has no network connectivity issues).\n\nI have everything on a UPS but it had never occurred to me that the coax -> ethernet could be an entry point for such a surge.",

How bout a micro on a smart plug to turn on remotely just to run a few services alongside the first Windows box. Spinning up Debian VM from scratch on Proxmox just to add Jellyfin, when helper-scripts had it there in various forms the whole time.\n\nBut I do enjoy learning, and so far it's been a welcome challenge.\n\nI'm also wondering what OS I should throw on one of these 8500T's 😆",

The challenge was that my vpn slowed everything down, even when I tried split tunneling. So I ran Virtualbox and another Windows VM in there for some services.\n\nI moved on from that to Ubuntu, then Ubuntu server in Virtualbox. It worked fine but I thought I could do better. So then I installed Ubuntu server onto the first Micro (6600T). That worked great but then I had two computers running what one used to.\n\nEventually I went to Proxmox to learn VM's and LXC's for my setup, and I think I first had it on the 6600T. I think I went all VM's. Worked great but needed a 3.5\" drive slot (or two) for my \"final\" setup.\n\nDid research, found the HP Elitedesk could fit 5 drives (2HDD 2NVME 1SSD) and got a great deal on that 10700. Loaded Proxmox on it from scratch to get a clean setup. So far it's working great for exactly what I need. I did convert some VM's to LXC's over time. I should install Docker (and I did once, long ago, on Ubuntu), but I really don't need it. \n\nIn the end, that one box now serves all my needs, is rock solid, and has plenty of room to expand with further services. \n\nI even have the original Proxmox build. It's moved from a 6600T to an 8500T, and now to a 9700T. I'm keeping it for the feels more than anything, but I may give it a new home on a diff network, or see if I can have a friend host it and manage it remotely.\n\nNow that my main server is setup almost exactly how I want it, I just use the micros to fulfill whatever whim I have next. Somewhat considering an \"all in one\" OS like CasaOS just to see if I can set up a remote node for a friend. \n\nWe'll see.",

I just sent them a [Thingiverse link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6504445), and a few days later I picked up the printed caddy.\n\nI used some small screws I had lying around to mount the SATA drive to the printed bracket and more random small screws to secure it in the case (the stock screws didn’t fit the 3D print).\n\nJust wanted to share in case anyone’s in the same boat—check your local library!\n\n",

From online research I found that the main contenders are Calibre Web and Kavita.\n\nKavita has much more modern UI, but I’m a little concerned that it’s running on .NET, so debugging and potential contributions might be more complex. Calibre feels much more mature, but it’s UX is pretty old-school.\n\nI’d love to have integration with Kindle (ie sending books to Kindle), and some integration for converting between formats. Any recommendations?",

You might want your NAS to get affected, so you decide to separate it. \n\nThe main concern with a mini PC is no room to expand with storage, so you might want to look into a SFF machine like a HP eiltedesk desk SFF that can fit two 3.5 inch drives, one NVMe and two 2.5 inch drives. \n\nUnless of course you don't mind on expanding your storage and one drive is enough. \n\nHope that helps",

You can virtualize a firewall like pfSense or OPNsense, but many prefer to use physical x86_64 hardware like mini PCs to run it because it can be more reliable and slightly less prone to misconfiguration in a homelab setup. For example, if you make a change on the wrong interface on a *sense VM in Proxmox (or your Proxmox network config gets wiped out somehow), you can inadvertently expose your Proxmox management GUI to the Internet. Meanwhile, to do the same on a physical box you would either have to manually switch the network cables around or reassign the interface in the *sense configuration.",

They rarely get updated and often have uptimes of several years. The firewall uses pfsense and provides internet usage, DHCP, assignments, vlans, various filtering and routing, etc etc.. a lot in fact. The dedicated NAS houses 95% of ALL our LAN data.. each PC and laptop have data mounts from the NAS, headless setups, etc. While the firewall is the king the NAS is the data workhorse for practically all systems, hardware based of virtually on our networks. \n\nThe virtualization servers.. mostly Proxmox but still have and ESXi server as well. Can be down or offline for 15-30 minutes at times for regular upgrades and maintenance as can their VMs and containers. If it was all virtualized including firewall and NAS it would break the network and users would loose access to the NAS, etc way to often.\n\nEveryone should have a virtualization server for general services like Plex, password management, etc however firewall and basic network infrastructure like your dhcp server as well as your data on a NAS should always be available.\n\npfSense themselves recommend NOT virtualizing pfSense especially when used as a primary perimeter firewall even though it can be done. Security is one reason.. as as much as many want to argue that this or that can be done.. it’s still a security issue. For me however it’s simply a reliability and uptime issue for the primary network. If you want to virtualized a mini pc, old desktop or something like a Dell R730XD server then install Proxmox and add a virtualized pfSense if you want but it would be secondary to the hardware based perimeter install. TrueNAS (core of scale) can easily be virtualized but its added complexity and increased downtime just don’t factor into better performance, reliability or uptime.. they also don’t recommend virtual installation. \n\nPros and cons to everything.",

        "body": "The only thing I like to run 'on the metal' is storage - I don't see the point in running it in a VM, especially if my VMs themselves are going to run from that storage. My NAS is comparatively simple, it has a bunch of HDDs and SSDs, running both LVM and ZFS respectively. It just mounts those logical volumes and then shares them out via (kerberised) NFS and SMB, plus a couple of iSCSI LUNs for VM VHDs. If the storage system dies, it takes my VM environment with it, no matter where it's hosted. Additionally, I have a learning Ceph cluster. Initially I tried building one with VMs, but as it was all hitting the same storage anyway (the NAS), it was a bit of a pain, so the current cluster is a set of USFFs with Ceph on the metal.\n\nThe only reason I can think of not to virtualise is low resources on the host. Running multiple kernels could be seen as wasted memory if you're limited to, say, 2GB RAM. But then containers come into play and drastically reduce the memory footprint. On the other hand, the sheer number of containers that modern microservice-driven applications need can undermine that! I have a learning K3s cluster running on little thin clients with only 2GB RAM each. The number of containers I need to run just to support the cluster itself is giving me pause about the suitability of the hardware (I'm using the Ceph cluster for backing storage, both iSCSI for container images and Ceph-CSI for container volumes, so there's a fair bit of memory overhead before I even run any services). I did laugh when I saw that the tiny Atom chips in these clients do actually support virtualisation! I can't imagine how they'd perform - you could maybe fit a few Slackware instances in that amount of RAM or a couple of basic Debian machines, but it does seem pretty pointless to have VTx support in an Atom!\n\nEverything else is virtualised - complex services are in VMs, simple services in LXC containers. I have a Proxmox Backup Server instance handling nightly backups to a dedicated HDD. My whole lab is configured and managed with Salt so I can handle installs and updates centrally. I also have automatic deployments via Cobbler so if I break something, virtual or physical, it's minimal fuss to reinstall it (though I'd usually try the backups first). I have had the RAID on the NAS fail before and I've had to rebuild my lab from backups - with everything virtualised, it took less than a day and most of that was transfer time.",

    "selftext": "I've recently been addicted to homelabbing, and I specifically bought an HP EliteDesk G3 800 Mini PC to serve me as my main homelab, it has 8GB DDR4 RAM and an old Intel i3 6100T.\n\nI have a huge Emby/Jellyfin library, and all the devices in my home can direct play.  \nI then shared my library to my friend, but it turns out his device is too old to have any compatible streams (maybe all my files are H265 instead of H264), and I have to enable transcoding on my side for him to be able to watch\n\nHere's the problem:  \nWhen transcoding happens, my CPU jumps up to 80 - 95% usage, there are however no stutters in the stream and its very watchable. I have extremely good cooling for the CPU thanks to me setting the fan speed to 50% at all times, which never lets the CPU get hotter than 60º. Though even after enabling hardware transcoding with Intel QuickSync (which I can't do in Emby because its a premium feature), I have not noticed any drop in CPU usage. I don't know if this is due to the weak CPU or if I'm doing something wrong, I did configure the docker-compose.yaml of Jellyfin to include my iGPU, so Jellyfin can communicate with my iGPU, but still not luck.\n\nI did some research and I've been seeing that CPUs are built to last very long at high loads (especially office grade CPUs like the one I have) if they're at a comfortable temperature.\n\nI am still unsure if I should let it transcode like this for my friend at this high CPU usage even if the CPU itself is ice cold\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2596f5vfeaf1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=b934d2f15940b139393e73aa01489dda5afb7273\n\n",

If it's a standard Cisco-style console blue cable, you can make an adapter. You'll need a regular mini-USB cable and a keystone jack, but the gist is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Brocade/comments/b71xtq/brocade_miniusb_to_rs232_cheat_cable/). With my Cisco cable, which has a FTDI chip in it, I have to use an app called [ft_prog from FTDI](https://ftdichip.com/utilities/#ft_prog) and invert RX and TX, else I get gibberish. I get to un-invert it if I need to console to my icx6610... which is fun.\n\n> usb mini to usb advertised as a serial cable\n\nI can't speak to what it was advertised as, but if it looks like a regular cable with no big chunky bits on either end, it probably isn't going to give you a console. Also if you plug a regular USB to mini into that console port you can kill the port. If you or someone else killed the port, when you get it working you'll get output, but it'll ignore your keystrokes.",

    "title": "Building a Low-Cost, Low-Power Home Server – Beginner Seeking Advice (~€100 Budget)",
    "selftext": "\nHi everyone! 👋\n\nI’m a complete beginner when it comes to home servers. I’ve never set one up before and honestly don’t have much technical experience — but it’s something I’ve always been curious about, and I finally decided to make a proper plan.\n\nOver time, I’ve collected some spare hardware from past tech projects or impulse buys. While they weren’t originally intended for a server, I believe they could now be reused to build a small, quiet, and energy-efficient home server for myself and my family. I’ve set my budget at around €100, using as much existing hardware as possible.\n\n⸻\n\n Hardware I Already Own:\n\t•\tSeagate 5TB external HDD (USB 3.0 – intended for backups, photos, documents)\n\t•\tUSB-A to dual micro-B cable (to connect 3.5″ external drives)\n\t•\tHDMI cable (4K-capable, for optional direct TV connection)\n\nThese are all leftover parts from older side projects – not originally intended for a server but hopefully reusable.\n\n⸻\n\nHardware I Plan to Buy:\n\t•\tLenovo ThinkCentre M625q Thin Client (AMD A6-9230e)\n\t•\t16GB SO-DIMM DDR4 RAM (~€15–20 used)\n\t•\t1TB Verbatim 2.5″ SATA SSD (~€40)\n\t•\tUSB-to-SATA adapter for additional drives (~€7.50)\n\t\n\nEstimated total cost: ~€90–100\n\n⸻\n\nUse Cases / Goals:\n\t•\tRun a Jellyfin media server\n(no transcoding; files pre-encoded as H.264 .mp4)\n\t•\tNextcloud for personal cloud storage (max. 3 users)\n\t•\tAdGuard Home for LAN-wide DNS filtering\n\t•\tBackup system for documents and photos/media\n\t•\tOptionally display photos on a TV via HDMI (during family events, etc.)\n\n⸻\n\nPriorities:\n\t•\t< 8W idle power draw\n\t•\tQuiet/passive cooling preferred\n\t•\tNo display connected – headless management via SSH / web UI\n\t•\tBeginner-friendly GUI setup – I’m not confident with command line\n\t•\tLAN-only; no Wi-Fi needed\n\n⸻\n\nQuestions I Have:\n\t1.\tIs the Thin Client (AMD A6-9230e) powerful enough for these tasks?\n\t2.\tWhich OS would you recommend for a GUI-based, beginner-friendly setup?\n(Linux Mint XFCE, DietPi, Proxmox, Ubuntu Server + Cockpit?)\n\t3.\tHow can I reduce power draw further, e.g. by spinning down drives automatically?\n\t4.\tAm I misunderstanding any critical part of this setup? What would you do differently?\n\n⸻\n\nAny advice or suggestions from more experienced folks would be hugely appreciated! 🙏\n",

    "selftext": "I wanna replace my old hardware stack. The Poweredges (2x R730xd, 2x R430) add up to a total of \\~615W on average, for relatively few that they actually do. So the plan is to consolidate and upgrade to current things.   \nI'm in the EU market and severely overwhelmed by the amount of systems and boards available, so I'd like some help. Looking to get three systems:\n\n**Hypervisor 1**\n\nWill run: \\~10 light to medium VMs\n\nRequires support for:\n\n* up to 128GB memory\n* 2x M.2 NVMe\n* 8x 3.5\" SATA HDD\n* 1x PCIe 3.0 x8 or higher\n\nNice to have:\n\n* ECC compatible\n* 2.5GbE Networking and/or additional PCIe slot for NIC\n\n**Hypervisor 2**\n\nWill run: 1 heavy VM (24/7), \\~10 light VMs\n\nRequires support for:\n\n* up to 128GB memory\n* 2x M.2 NVMe\n* 1x PCIe 3.0 x8 or higher\n* 2x 2.5\" SATA or add. 2x M.2 NVMe or add. PCIe 3.0 x8 w/ bifurcation\n\nNice to have:\n\n* ECC compatible\n\n**Hypervisor 3 (offsite)**\n\nWill run: 1 light, 1 medium VM\n\nRequires support for:\n\n* 32GB memory\n* 2x M.2 NVMe\n* 8x 3.5\" SATA HDD\n* 2x 2.5\" SATA or add. 2x M.2 NVMe or add. PCIe 3.0 x8 w/ bifurcation\n\n\n\nMy primary concern is power consumption. I need to reduce that to the lowest possible value, since it's really expensive over here. Disks need to do proper spindown (does *not* work well with my current PERC controllers), boards and CPUs need to be efficient.\n\nI'm happy to make it DIY builds, but I'm just as happy with a prebuilt if it's not compromising power efficiency.\n\nBudget depends on how much power the new setup actually saves, I'd say 500-750€ per 100W saved.\n\nWhat hidden gems are out there in the used market? Do AM4 builds make sense, are there some nice Supermicro boards that would work perfectly for me? What's the current go-tos for this?\n\nThanks to anyone who puts in the effort to even read this, I highly appreciate your input. Much love!",

As such, I heard online that it's better to run your OS as well as any applications and VMs off of an SSD for speed reasons as well as certain softwares requre you to have your OS seperate from the RAID disks. I decided to buy a 1TB SSD M.2 and replace the 256GB M.2 on my current computer so that the end result is my workstation will have 1TB and my server will have 256GB. \n\nMy question is, how should I transfer my OS on my workstation to the new SSD?\n\nI got into this because my workstation has been getting bloated and I kind of want to format it and start fresh anyway, but I do want to save of my files. I was thinking of installing an OS on the server and running it off of a USB until I can get the files I want transfered off of my workstation, then do the big switch, but I'm open to suggestions. I would like to keep my windows license until I can experiement with ubuntu on a VM and I'm thinking of installing ProxMox on the server, but I have zero experience with that. ",

This has included building a PFsense box, getting some Unifi switches, moving to DAC-cables over Cat6 and finally it was time to upgrade my Kubernetes cluster nodes. \n\nThis starts by cordoning off a node and draining it of any workloads then shutting it down to install a Nic I picked up on ebay for $20. Then rebooting, adding the interface to netplan and updating the DHCP server to use the right IP and boom I was in 10 Gbit internet land!\n\n**Just one problem**, *half my ram had disappeared*. I had 2 16GB modules and one of them had just disappeared. I started troubleshooting\n\n1. Take out the server and clean all the connectors with compressed air - nothing\n\n2. Swap RAM sticks - still busted\n\n3. Move PCIe card to different slot - no change\n\n4. Upgrade the BIOS - no change\n\n5. Maybe I'm limited by PSU size? Each server is only 180W. Upgrade to 250W - no change\n\n6. Stumble on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0nJV0jelkg) from Mark Furneaux - break out some scotch tape and cover the 5-6 pins on the pcie card and everything works great. My ram is back and I have 10Gb networking.\n\nApparently, [SMBus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Bus) provides conflicting information to the motherboard **causing the motherboard to disable an entire channel of memory**. This can be fixed by just disabling SMBus on your card entirely. There's no setting for that, no jumper to use, you just literally cover those pins with tape so they can't communicate at all. If you go to do this, I recommend watching the full video and don't cover the pins on the back of the card as these are different pins entirely. \n\nAfter several weeks of fiddling to get this working I feel dumber for having discovered the solution. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/euw3my54u2af1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=dca7c6ce29cda87b033c1804aaa1a809b327e38a\n\n",

Swapped cables, different port from hba, adapter, all the same. I tried to connect the 4 drives but now 2 on each port, all got detected. \n\nFor info, the 8087 to sata cables are numbered p1 thru p4. So drives connevted to p2, p3 are shown, this behavior is on both hba ports. I do have 2x 16gb cards. Would it have to do anything with this behaviour? And sometimes the disks dont show up in truenas at all. All are wd red plus 4tb drives, 2 drives got off of amazon US and 2 from reputed retailer from Indonesia (went on vacation and got them cuz cheaper than in india lol)...\n\n\nEdit: Or all these headaches are maybe due to faulty 8088-8088 cable that came with the 35$ ebay lsi hba 9207-8e adapter from chinese seller 🤷‍♂️",

This tailnet is run in its own LXC container, and broadcasts routes to all my Proxmox services and all DNS queries on my tailnet is routed to my pihole with custom local DNS records. I think this setup should run well in the long term and the only manual configurations I'll need to add when making new containers is to add the new custom local DNS records. Any suggestions for security or in general?\n\nSide note: As far as I could find, subnetting through a Tailscale machine forces the packets to appear as if they came from the tailnet gateway container, is there anyway to overcome this?\n\nAny comments are welcome always looking to improve",

    "selftext": "I've recently setup Proxmox on a Minisforum MS-A2. On this, I've installed opnsense (amongst other things), as I've been concerned about running an out-of-date pfsense box for a while (plus open-source rules, not to mention nicer overall experience), plus I love tinkering and trying different things. I know that by having it virtualised, I have much better options for updating, snapshots, compared to hoping for the best with a physical box.\n\nThis setup is for a home internet connection, with only a single inbound line from the ISP - no bonding or similar here. The internal network serves the typical things such as laptops, a PC, tablets, phones, etc. (via an Omada Wifi AP), but also serves an Unraid server and some smaller 'dev boxes' (mini PC's typically running docker, software dev stacks, etc).\n\nThe Opnsense setup handles DHCP (via ISC, since the Kea one seemed to have some problems when I tried), DNS is served by 2 adguard servers (and 2 more available on other systems) but the addresses of these are also 'distributed' to clients via Opnsense.\n\nI'm now hitting a bit of a dilemna: How do I go about handling network redundancy?\n\nSee, I'm currently considering adding a bunch of KVM's to the network for various systems, because even though I have VPN setup for remote access, I still know that doesn't allow me to e.g. access BIOS remotely.\n\nIf the proxmox system goes down, or I need to perform maintenance, I lose access to the entire network (as you'd expect), including KVM's.\n\nI don't necessarily want to be running something all the time as a redundant system, but I'd like to have something that I can hook up temporarily to enable at least LAN to remain available so I can access the KVM's, and other systems still on the network.\n\nI don't necessarily need WAN access at these times, so I'm assuming that this theoretical failover could live somewhere else in the network (i.e. physical location difference)?\n\nIn essence, I want to create a situation where I can still perform any essential maintenance without physically having to go to a machine and hook up monitor, keyboard, etc. Ideally, I'd like to ensure IP's remain the same in this situation so I don't have to go hunting through a DHCP interface, but I don't know how feasible that is.\n\nWhat would be the bare minimum I'd need to create this fallback/failover? Could I just spin up a DHCP docker container on another system? Would it be better to format the old pfsense box with opnsense and setup high-availability (even if the backup system will only be connected during maintenance)?\n\nOpen to hearing any and all reasonable, sensible suggestions.\n\n(Knowledge context: I know a lot about tech, but networking is an area I've always lagged behind in, so please assume I'm an idiot)",

It's connected to a management port on my switch, so it's possible to manage the network from there. Also, it's a KVM so I can manage the connected servers from there (including power cycling and so on).\n\nI have Tailscale running on it, so I can connect from anywhere, and Tailscale allows to run subnet router, so I can access the network resources remotely as if I was there. Of course, it's higher latency and lower bandwidth, but for most remote access and monitoring it's good enough.",

After 3 months the machine simply could not boot into bios or anywhere else to be precise.\n\nI bought the product from amazon, who told me to reach to minisforum support which I did... Ended up waiting around 5-6 weeks for a replacement. (not to mention that I was asked to perform around 10 troubleshooting steps and take photos and 1 video of the issue)\n\nThe replacement came today and guess what... it does not boot !!! same f. issue...\n\nI have tested the ram (crucial 4800MT 2x 32GB with all 6 permutations), no luck.  \nI have tested booting with and without SSDs, no luck.\n\nI tested with the ms-01 SSDs and ram in another minisforum ms-a2 and it instantly worked !!?!?!?!!!!!\n\nWhat is wrong with the ms-01 in the first place and how come the second unit has the exact same issue???\n\nI have reached out to Amazon, told them the whole story and they stepped in and offered me full refund for return of the unit which I'll do in a few days.\n\nDid anyone else shared a similar experience with minisforum units?\n\nThanks!",

        "body": "Well what do you want to do? Really going to depend on your usecase, uptime, power needs, form-factor, etc..\n\nI have a pretty large contingent of AM4 based devices in my lab, and have everything from consumer to pro-sumer, to server gear.\n\nConsumer: Ubuntu AI Server running 2x 3090s on a X570 ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero + 5600x - although top of the line components, it 'lacks' ECC, so I wouldnt use it anywhere that has sensitive data, despite having 8 SATA ports. Its on and running 50% of the time and have had no problems. \n\nPro-Sumer: Ubuntu server running on a ASUS pro WS-X570 Ace with a 5950x + 1 3090 - great mobo, WS grade components/power management - and supports ECC. This is on all the time, and is stable, runs great, despite not being 'server grade'.\n\nServer: Just got a AsRock Rack X470D4U for a new NAS build paired it with a 3600x - supports ECC and has IPMI. I havent put it through its paces yet, but it seems to be perfect for a NAS usecase.\n\nI would not use an iGPU for any of them, despite older iGPUs being pretty crap, a low profile card for some jellyfin transcoding (like a p2000) can be had for $50, and that opens up non-igpu chips for you, often easier to find and more options. \n\nTL;DR - if youre looking for data sensitive workloads and 100% headless capability, then a server grade board would make sense. Otherwise, I would go with pro-sumer gear. It offers more flexibility, while being reliable and having ECC capabilities.",

    "selftext": "Hello fellow homelabbers\n\nI encountered a rather strange issue with my X540 NIC, the issue is x540 reports 10000 mbps link speed while real speed can't get remotely close to it.\n\nLet me start with my environment and setup: Dell T430 with e5 v4 cpus, dual X540-T2 (one reports all info in dell idrac, the other one works but doesn't report anything) connected to 10GBPS port in my router with CAT 7 cable, 3GBPS fibre internet, ESXI 8.0 U3 for bare metal and ubuntu 22.04 for my vms.\n\nIssues: I originally bought a x540 but realized it doesn't report anything (not even link status, firmware etc) in idrac but it works, just not at 10 gbps, I can only get 600-700mbps using speedtest-cli, which I thought the NIC was some remanufactured stuff (I heard some chinese reman nic are not as stable), so I went out and bought another genuine one, this time it reports its info correctly, I verified its running the latest firmware for T430, however it still stuck at the same speed (600-700mbps), while it does report 10000 mbps link speed in ESXI.\n\nAttempts to diagnose: I tried to diagnose it by setting auto negotiate to enabled in ESXI and set port speed to 1GBPS in my router to see if auto negotiate will recognize it, however when I checked ESXI, it still reports 10000mbps link speed, which is strange, in my understanding it id supposed to show 1000mbps since the router port has been changed to 1000mbps. \n\nThoughts: Maybe my ISP provided router doesn't have the best compatibility with x540? In this case if I put a managed switch in between the server and the router it might improve the compatibility?\n\nThanks in advance for everyone's input and help, and thanks for reading my post. If anymore information is needed please let me know, I am rather new to the server world.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi all - \n\n  \nBig fan of this community - I enjoy watching the home lab porn and seeing what people have put together for things!  I've been planning out a start to my own home lab (I've been using PCs of some sort since the 90s, but never really had more than my gaming PC upgrades along the way).\n\nSome CPU instability has prompted me to upgrade the core components of my current gaming PC, and I've been thinking about some options of what to do with the extra hardware.  Contemplating a few possible choices, with the following \"extra\" hardware available:\n\n* MSI MEG X570 ACE Motherboard (AM4 Slot, DDR4 5000+ support, 4x DIMM slots, 2x M.2 for strorage, 2.5GBps / 802.11 ax WiFi.\n* 16GB Corsair  Vengeance DDR4 3200 (stealing from my wife's system as I'm giving her my old memory)\n* 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 6000 memory (came free with one of the components I bought, but I had bigger and better plans for my gaming system).\n* Assorted power supplies, cases, CPU coolers and old graphics cards (none that can be trusted for processing current workloads, but will be enough to attach a monitor if and when I need to).\n\nFor a use case, I mostly want to do:\n\n* Low-usage household Plex Server.  Currently running this off of a RaspPi.\n* PostgreSQL for personal use, training, et cetera.  My wife is looking to learn how to use SQL as opposed to the visual data analytics tools she's learning in her masters program.  I'd also probably eventually use this as the backend if I come up with some home-grown home automation tools, but not going to be running anything in production.\n* Local LLM.  I know ideal is a GPU with a beefy amount of memory for this, although that's not necessarily realistic in the current budget.\n* Proxmox or another virtualization solution.  I've always been a software development type of guy so haven't gotten as much into infrastructure, but I'd love to learn more about this.\n* Inspire my son.  He's 6 years old now and as he grows up, I'd love to see if he's interested in computers in the same way that I have been.\n\nI was considering repurposing the AM4 motherboard and adding a new CPU and storage, but as I write that out, it doesn't seem practical or really any significant cost savings over the other two options I've been considering:\n\n* New AM5 Motherboard and CPU (thinking a B650M / 8500G combo \\[$271 from Newegg\\], adding about $50-70 for a new SSD and repurposing the external 4TB HD I had with the RaspPi for storage, totalling a little under $350.\n* Used rackmount server hardware: Was considering something along the lines of a used R730 (2U size), 2x Intel Xeon E5-2620v3 (12 cores total), 2x 32 GB DDR4 PC4-19200, 2x 400GB SAS SSD, 2.4 TB SAS 10K 12 Gb/s, to the tune of a little under $700 from New Server Life including a Tesla P4 8GB \\[less than $500 without\\] (or potentially looking for sales here or elsewhere on the internet).\n\nAny thoughts from the folks here?  I like repurposing what I have and trying to be more cost-effective, but the deeply nerdy part of me also wants to play around with real server hardware.  I can keep the server in the basement where noise isn't as much of a factor (and also where the air is going to be a little cooler than the rest of the house).  But I know it's also going to be more expensive to run considering the electrical costs.",

I get between 90 - 95% perf depending on the task and stack.\nI'm able to passthrough the eGPU to containers and VMs.\nAlso with this setup, there is a great guide on github about using thunderbolt4 networking with proxmox, mainly for live migrations and HA etc. The perf you get for the price of three Thunderbolt 4 cables is unmatched. It allows me to free the 10Gb port's bandwidth for other stuff without comprises. Sorry it's a bit long, but I enjoyed seeing it through this weekend 🙂",

    "title": "Are My JBOD Plans Sound? (Coraid, 4x JBODs, Plex + AI + Cold Storage Setup)",
    "selftext": "Hi all — I picked up 4 identical Coraid JBODs off Facebook Marketplace for $70 total. (I previously asked you all your opinions in a thread a few days ago) I’m working on converting them into a modern high-capacity storage backend for:\n\n•\tAn AI node — frequent read/write for training and live file access\n•\tGaming/media server — for large game libraries and media storage\n•\tPlex — 4K and 1080p streaming from Blu-ray rips\n•\tCold storage — surveillance footage, backups, log archives, etc.\n\nI plan to use UnRAID to manage the entire setup with around 25% of the drives dedicated to redundancy. 16 of 64 total drives. Open to other opinions on if this is too much or too little. Each JBOD will be filled with 28TB IronWolf drives eventually. I understand the cost of this amount of storage. The three servers (Plex, gaming/media, and the AI node) will be in separate 4U cases and access storage via external SAS. The goal is to treat the rack like one integrated system with shared storage across all nodes.\n\nCurrent JBOD Hardware (per unit):\n•\tBackplane (likely 3Gbps SAS/SATA)\n•\tSupermicro X7DBE motherboard (not planning to use it)\n•\t2x 1GB ECC Hynix RAM\n•\t2x Ablecom 800W hot-swap PSUs\n•\t3x hot-swap fans\n•\tOnly one unit has full drive trays — the others are missing most or all\n\nPlanned Upgrades (per JBOD):\n•     16x drive trays\n•\tReplace fans for airflow and noise control\n•\tAdd SFF-8088 or SFF-8644 external SAS interface (for connection to host)\n•\tPossibly replace backplane if performance is bottlenecked (3Gbps vs 6Gbps/12Gbps)\n•\tConnect to an LSI 9201-16e or 9300-8e (IT mode) on host machines\n•\tNo OS, CPU, or RAM needed — these will act purely as storage shelves\n•\tAll JBODs will be part of a single UnRAID array\n\nQuestions:\n1.\tDoes this overall architecture sound viable and scalable long term?\n2.\tCan UnRAID effectively pool drives across multiple JBODs with parity spread anywhere?\n3.\tIs it possible to modernize the backplane or trays without a full chassis replacement?\n4.\tAre there any hidden limitations (throughput, thermal, electrical) I should watch out for?\n5.\tWould upgrading to newer 6Gbps/12Gbps backplanes significantly improve performance for heavy AI/Plex workloads?\n\nTrying to get this build right without overspending on things I don’t need yet. Appreciate any insight from those who’ve worked with similar JBOD setups.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

        "body": "Based solely on this reply alone I suggest you take a big step back and take a breath and not invest any more cash just yet... Your entire premise is flawed.  I looked at your previous post - you called those \"Coraid JBOD's\" - those are in fact, not JBOD's - those are old ass SuperMicro servers (with a Coraid badge) with disks in the front. A JBOD by definition is \"just a bunch of disks\", meaning that it lacks any \"brains\". UnRaid is an operating system which can take any number of disks that are 'directly attached' to the OS and pool them into 1 larger filesystem which you would then access over a NETWORK protocol.  SAS is a STORAGE protocol used for a single host to talk to 1 or more physical disks. Similar to how USB and a USB hub can let a single laptop talk to a number of connected external harddisks.  However, what you can NOT do with SAS, or with USB in this case, is connect those drives to multiple computers at the same time - that's just simply not how it works. You have to use some sort of Network based protocol like NFS, Samba/CIFS (aka windows file sharing), S3, Lustre, etc that lets multiple computers talk over the network to a central computer (aka NAS) that can talk to those disks.\n\nSome terminology that I hope will help you\n\n\\* NAS - Network Attached Storage. A NAS is a computer that can share it's filesystem over a network.\n\n\\* SAN - Storage Area Network. This gets complicated, and the technology isn't as common these days but it's a way to created a switched network of storage devices. And it requires specialized equipment including SAN Switches (not just any switch, but a fibrechannel/SAN switch) and devices that can speak that language. I highly suggest you stay away from this.\n\n\\* DAS - Direct Attached Storage. This is where JBOD and Raid Array shelves come in. A DAS device is basically a chunk of storage with 1 or more disks directly attached to another server through a protocol like SAS, eSATA, or USB. a DAS implies 'external to the computer' in it's name, at least in my opinion so i'm not counting like internally connected sata and nvme disks.\n\nTo answer your questions in turn:\n\nDoes this overall architecture sound viable and scalable long term? -- No, its not viable, you can not have 3 servers talk to 1 device over SAS - that's simply not how it works.\n\nCan UnRAID effectively pool drives across multiple JBODs with parity spread anywhere? -- Yes, with the caveat that those 3 things you purchased \\*ARE NOT JBODS\\*. To give you an example of what \\_would\\_ work. You can buy say 3 NetApp DS4246 shelves, A full Computer with an OS like Unraid, and a SAS HBA PCI-e card that can talk to them - you can daisy chain them together and let all 3 shelves be addressed by a single HBA card. Unraid would see all 64 disks as individual disks and you could pool them into a single filesystem with parity and whatnot, and from Unraid expose them on your network over Samba/Cifs/NFS/Whatever to your other 3 servers.\n\nIs it possible to modernize the backplane or trays without a full chassis replacement?  -- To put it simply, I highly doubt you can 'upgrade the backplane' on these servers. Typically the backplane board are proprietary and their dimensions and screw holes and whatnot change with each generation of hardware a company like SuperMicro may create. Can you fit backplanes from newer models into older ones? maybe? depends entirely on the models.\n\nAre there any hidden limitations (throughput, thermal, electrical) I should watch out for? -- Oh yes, lots. 48 disks \\_alone\\_ will require at minimum 500 watts of power run, and in turn will require 500 watts worth of cooling to keep at temperature, not to mention the noise. 500 watts 24/7 in my part of the world is about $60/month in electricity and I'm being conservative with my estimates.\n\nWould upgrading to newer 6Gbps/12Gbps backplanes significantly improve performance for heavy AI/Plex workloads? -- 3/6/12gbps is the maximum throughput you could get over one of the SAS channels on your HBA, which then has to go out a NETWORK which you have not described. If your whole setup is running over 1gig ethernet then your bottleneck will be the network.",

You can also simply run traditional VMs and LXCs if that has your preference. I run a combination of both.\n\nMemory will be your biggest enemy, so make sure to have plenty of that available. 8GB per node will be an absolute minimum.\n\nMy nodes have 48GB memory each so I can run multiple clusters to test and play with, alongside my traditional VMs/LXCs.\n\nRegarding kubernetes, it depends on what you want to learn from it. If it's just the application side then I would suggest a managed solution like k3s/microk8s/k8s for simplicity and your sanity.\n\nIf you also wish to learn the architecture/infrastructure side then create your own with kubeadm and play with all the different kind of setups like a custom CNI or go without kubeproxy :D. You will learn all the infrastructure components and how they work with eachother, plus how to really debug when it's broken :)\n\nOnce you've learned that you can always switch to a managed k8s solution to make your life easier. I've been running Canonical k8s for a year now and so far it's been the best managed k8s I've used. Worked with Rancher, k3s, microk8s and now also k8s. They made it available in a snap and it's now a one minute bootstrap just like the others.\n\nTalos is a bit different from the rest. Not only will you be working with kubernetes from scratch, you'll also be working with a read only operating system that you have no traditional access to. Depending on your skillset my recommendation would be to do one thing at a time. You can always try Talos later on once you've got the hang of Kubernetes itself.",

    "selftext": "I'm setting up my first computer dedicated to work as a home server as my entryway into homelab'ing. I decided to try using proxmox and docker for my services since this combination seems to be popular in the hobby.\n\nThe main purpose of this server will be for Jellyfin and *arr services (keep in mind that all these technologies are new to me) with mixed capacity HDDs using a mergerfs+snapraid setup. I also plan to store backups of the home directory of my main PC, but this part should be trivial.\n\nWhat I'm struggling with is how to properly set things within Proxmox:\n- Should the docker containers be created inside a LXC? This seems redundant since both are containerization technologies.\n- Should I create a VM and run the docker containers inside it? This seems more right to me, but I think the VM will use a virtualized disk and I don't know how I'm gonna create a mountpoint to my disks with the media storage to bind the docker containers.\n- Should I create the docker containers in the proxmox host itself? This seems weird to me as well, as there would be no advantage in using proxmox over any other Linux distro using cockpit to manage it over the network. But maybe that would be more suitable to my use case anyways.",

Some switches, known as \"multilayer\" can act as routers, as well. \n\nThe simplest way to create two separate networks is physically; if your router has multiple LAN ports, you simply have each interface assigned to a different network. Then each interface connects to a separate switch and separate devices. \n\nYou can consolidate hardware, however, by using Virtual LANs. A single LAN port hosts two different VLANs to a single *managed* switch, which then distributes those VLANs to different ports and devices. In a simple set up, say that port 1 on the switch connects *both* VLANs to the router, then ports 2-5 are only connected to VLAN1, and ports 6-8 are connected to VLAN2.  You essentially have two separate switches, on separate networks, running on a single piece of hardware. Ports 2-5 can see only each other and the router, while ports 6-8 see only each other and the router. Anything that wants to cross between those VLANs needs to travel through the router to get there.",

However I have a fireplace that has a wired connection into the flex mini switch.  I can configure the fireplace to the IoT vlan by configuring the appropriate flex mini port as an access port for the IoT vlan. However due to limitations of the flex mini, I cannot include any other tagged traffic on that port.  \n\nIn terms of policy, I’d like to prevent my IoT network from accessing other networks (except where a connection has been established from another permitted vlan). I would like my trusted vlan to be able to access the fireplace as controlling the fireplace is done over a local network rather than via the Internet. \n\nMay I please have some guidance on how to solution for this?\n\nThank you",

Because they are on different networks, it goes to the router (UCG). \n\nLet’s say the layer 3 rules permit access to the IoT device. \n\nRouter then forwards the packet to the IoT device IP, i imagine tagged with vlan 99. When this packet hits the lite 8 switch it enters one trunk port and leaves the other still tagged with vlan 99. When it hits the trunk port on the flex mini, it’s routed through the access port with the tag removed. \n\nAm I right or mistaken ?

I plan on 2 x EPYC 7663 and 2 x Noctua NH-U14s TR5-SP6 (with the optional SP3 mounting kit).\nHowever, I have seen issues around cooling the VRMs on forums (like STH). Some people say it just can't be cooled without Supermicro air ducts and high pressure, high RPM fans. Some people say it's fine being left alone.\nThe point of this post is, what do I do? Should I make custom air ducts for the VRM? Should I worry? Should I go for a single socket instead as the VRM has more space for air?\nI also read horizontal cases are better for airflow in this area of computing, is that true? Should I go for bottom-top or front-back?\nThanks a lot guys.",

    "selftext": "Mods, if this doesn't align with the sub, feel free to delete.. just wasn't sure where else to post this.\n\nLong story short, I've been slowly building up my homelab. It's mostly for personal use and learning, so a bunch of raspberry pis. (Have a couple other posts on my set-up). \n\nAnyways, I was thinking about the 3-2-1 standard for backup. (3 copies of data, 2 types of media, one stored off-site). I'm not against cloud backup, but don't want to rely on it 100% and also don't want to pay costs if I don't have to.. So, I'm like well what if I had a second NAS in my office, that could solve the problem. \n\n(Disclaimer: I did very with my office that I can do this. I can't connect to/use the network, but they are 100% ok with me connecting a low-power non-networked device). \n\nAt the house, I already have a pretty decent solution, a RasPi4 in an argon eon with 8 TB of SSDs. It doesn't meet my \"full\" data storage needs, but is more than enough for essential/critical backups. And now I have a second eon at the office, fully powered (also 8 TB) but not networked.. So I needed a way to get data from A to B.\n\nSo, with a little bit of ingenuity, I created a cron to check for changes/updates to files, move those updates to a specific folder, then use syncthing to automatically sych that to my phone. And at the office, I setup the RasPi to act as a router/AP (not networked) so that my phone will automatically connect to it, and a second syncthing connection to update the file, and a second cron to update/add/ect. those changes.\n\nIt's not ground breaking, or anything special (and definitely doesn't meet enterprise requirements). But it works! And was super fun to setup.",

Obviously don't knock down any load-bearing walls, but if you drilled a small hole in the walls and then patched it, nobody is going to know.\n\nThat aside, you might also be able to run some fiber.

        "body": "This is not the right question to ask. The differences are not \"between brands\"; they are between models. And often, within a model.\n\nLenovo ThinkCentre M600 Tiny has four processor options. Two of them are embedded dual-core Celerons that come with a massive heat spreader. The other two are embedded quad-core Pentiums that come with a small heatsink and a fan. So the same model can be actively or passively cooled, depending on the processor option.\n\nLenovo models whose numbers end in zero have Intel processors; if the model number ends in 5, it's an AMD-powered device. HP has a similar convention.\n\nLenovo ThinkCentre M720q Tiny has a removable processor, which can be anything from a Celeron to an i9. M720q, M920q, and M920x have a rare feature, a full-size PCIe slot. M920x, additionally, has a second NVMe slot.\n\nMany HP models come in two power levels. Lower-power devices have an aluminum heatsink. Higher-power devices have a copper heatsink and an additional air intake in the form of many tiny holes in the top cover.\n\nThe only difference between the brands I can think of right now is, HP recently removed device specifications from its support site.\n\n\\[**Later addition**\\] Just thought of another one: 2.5\" drive mounting. Dell usually has caddies with blue plastic inserts (the drive hangs on four pins molded into the insert, the insert clicks into place inside the metal caddy), Lenovo and HP used to rely on traditional screws with big rubberized washers that roll into the grooves in the caddy. More recently though, Lenovo went with a flexible plastic caddy with pins (similar to Dell's caddy insert but mounted upside down) that clicks into place directly to the case on one side and to the processor cooler assembly on the other...",

They also usually have a slightly more powerful processor like an i5-8500 vs in the micro it would have an i5-8500T. But that also means the power draw might be a tiny bit more.

    "selftext": "Hey y'all, been trying to troubleshoot my AGH DNS as webpages sometimes load longer than I'd expect (upwards of a few seconds). This doesn't appear to be a WAN issue, as it happens with my locally hosted Homepage as well. I've gone back and forth with chatgpt (yes ik ai can be wrong but it's worked for me previously and haven't had much luck googling around).\n\nEverything *eventually* ends up at the right place, and caching did help a bit. I have 2 upstream servers in parallel: 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. If this is not the appropriate place to post lmk\n\nEDIT: So apparently AGH has a weird rate limit default that causes this issue. The default is 20 requests per second per client. This gets saturated very quickly if you're navigating search engines or anything that's making requests to other sites in the background (which nowadays, most sites do this). **Setting this rate limit to 0** fixed the issue for me. Hopefully this helps someone in the future ",

The Wifi network also participates. I got a $5 router from the thrift store to set up an IoT wifi network at my house this way.\n\nYou can also look at the DevTools in your browser (press F12 for chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge), go to the Network tab, and see how long it takes for everything to load.

Truenas also has a very nice interface when creating dockers vs portainer. \n\n  \nWhen it comes to proxmox, I do have an Ubuntu server VM for other dockers applications and can be backed up with the proxmox backup server. What a sweet feature! I dont have to worry about HA with the other servers in the cluster as its not really mission critical. Even though its on a 10gb network. Runs for a week out of the month at most. \n\n  \nMy proxmox clusters main purpose is building VM's for testing and its easy to shuffle them around and really fast to build them. I have a Opensense Firewall VM separating everything from my main network, 2x DC's, a File Server (for testing GP, not data storage), WDS, and an NPS Server running in the cluster.

But if they're already in my switch, there's really nothing I can do except clean my soul with bleach. Jk, network segregation might actually be useful here. Hence VLAN support would be nice. Again, the need for a cheap managed switch. \n\n\n> A simple linux nat box is way more secure and will outperform the cisco routers by a magnitude\n\n\n\nIt's not Linux, but I do run an OPNSense firewall/router as my WAN. A beelink with double 2.5Gbe NICs. I love it. I'm going to soon upgrade my AP's to OpenWrt and try to run a WPA2 mesh with resold wifi/router bundles. (I find some at Goodwill and whatnot). Eventually WPA3, but I need to run WPA2 for older devices - at least for the next few years. Having a mesh mitigates wpa2 deauth attacks.\n\n\nThe issue I have, is that everything is hard wired. I've been clustering my devices (I have a 4x dell optiplex usff k3s cluster, but I'd like to do more), so minimal latency is paramount, and getting cheap 24-48 port switches that support STP for future upgrades are pretty hard to find new. Discarded Cisco switches are (pun intended) ubiquitous and usually I can find them at local auction/surplus/e-recyclers for less than 100 dollars. (Sometimes the e-recyclers I can get for 20 bucks, depending... But I have to talk to people. Yuck.)\n\n\nBtw - I love using refurbed gear. I've been getting phenomenal results so far and really good compute/price ratio. The most I've spent on my stack are the ubiquiti switches. But again, I need more ports. The 10G ubiquiti ports are an option... But they're too expensive for me rn. Although, it's probably what I'm going to end up doing.",

But I'm not sure how to proceed and what to research next. I assume:\n\n1. remove Windows on Elitedesk mini and install Proxmox and go VMs\n\n2. Elitedesk will serve as Plex server\n\n3. Connect Elitedesk to Unmanaged switch that will connect to NAS\n\n4. Pi-hole will connect to unmanaged switch\n\n5. Firestick will connect to Pi-hole via wi-fi\n\n6. Firestick will install plex app and connect to Plex server via wifi\n\nare these assumptions correct? will appreciate guidance for a newbie. thank you!",

    "selftext": "Hello! I'm a software engineer looking for some advice for my plan to create a fun touchscreen application for my children to use to set and achieve some arbitrary weekly goals. This experiment is a multi pronged attempt to motivate their positive behaviors, introduce them to what I do for a living, and pique their interest in technology.\n\n1. Touchscreen device. A decent size \\~24\", somewhat resilient, touchscreen I plan on mounting for my kids to use to play with the app. If the application extremely easy for me, but not a deal breaker I have deploy a compiled app to it. I may just use their amazon fire tablets if this is cost prohibitive since they already have web browsers and I could administrate the site easier.\n2. Node.js & Mongodb host. I'm debating using a raspberry pie to accomplish this but I'm worried about using an OS/device that I have no experience with and I've seen some refurbished Dell R620s with lots of capacity, power, and redundancy for under < $300.\n\nI'd like the host to be rack mountable so I can put it in one of my racks, but I'll buy a shelf if I have to.\n\nSpecs I anticipate needing:\n\n|Min|Preferred|\n|:-|:-|\n|1 GB RAM|2 GB RAM|\n|10 GB Storage|10 GB storage|\n|1 CPU core (requires AVX support)|2 CPU cores (requires AVX support)|\n\nThis is my first run at a homelab, I've done tons of hosting stuff on my home PC but I want a more dedicated setup to learn and grow with, so either an array of Raspberry Pis or the dell. I could drive forward on my own and sort this out but I thought it would be wiser to ping some more experienced folks here first. It's worth noting that aside from this specific software project, I will probably expose a port for some externally accessible apps in the future.  \n  \n",

A pi is 80 ish bucks plus all the things you need to buy with it. A nuc is 200 bucks and will do everything you want. The 1lpc is the better form factor if your willing to buy used and comes from a bunch of vendors ( [https://www.servethehome.com/perfect-project-tinyminimicro-pushing-a-1l-pc-as-a-server-concept-intel-hp-sabrent-crucial/](https://www.servethehome.com/perfect-project-tinyminimicro-pushing-a-1l-pc-as-a-server-concept-intel-hp-sabrent-crucial/)  to get a sense of what's in this space). You're looking at fast enough hardware here, the used 1lpc's (15-8500) is a sweet spot for performance/value in this space.",

    "selftext": "Hi... thought I'd introduce my mobile lab, since I have learned so much from this sub during the project. Still work-in-progress (aren't they all?) but it has flickered to life and become useful. \n\nThe 10-inch rack frame is a double-wide pair of 8U spaces made from 2020, with rails on front and back for a total of 32U with shared depth. A Minisforum PC carries the GPU for local AI and ML tasks, and there are Pi5s with 1TB for Home Assistant and dev, an old Pi3 for Octopi, and a Pi4 for SDR. There is also a NUC with a fresh Ubuntu install that I thought was going to be the home of my daunting Immich corpus before moving it to TrueNAS, and that also runs Jellyfin for my video archives and Tailscale (for network magic that I never knew existed).\n\nThere's a battery power system (not exactly UPS behavior... no NUT... but HA monitors it enough to let me get notifications if there are issues), as well as Meshtastic, a fairly robust video production system (ATEM Mini pro ISO), and a MOTU audio interface for recording. \n\nAC distribution is on the back of the cart and there's a DC distribution region for +5 and +12 to cut down on wall warts. Up on the roof is a Flint router, and it catches exit air from the compute stack on the left side (so far it's thermally behaving). And I have an overkill PiKVM to manage consoles, though I had to add a \"dumb\" one to make it easier to switch local devices between PC and all the rest. Just now working on a swing-arm table for a MacBook Pro for A/V stuff and a stand-alone terminal. \n\nThis sub has been super helpful as I have been taking on some of the learning curves (like that huge KVM one), and I hope this wheeled contraption is a welcome fit. I'm used to the 19-inch rack world, and have a media digitizing lab with 60U of rackspace... but it is just so much. I wanted to get my personal tools and lifelong archives into one portable thing that can someday be my docent, not a mountain that would take weeks to reassemble after a move. This machine is a fairly comfortable workstation with keyboard drawer and swing-out screen (plus that little LCD on the Prompter and the sidecar Mac), so it is not too bad as a geeky stand-alone homelab. If I could wave a magic wand, I'd want 27-inch monitors with better ergonomics, but it has to clear doorways. \n\nI did a [Bionode intro post](https://microship.com/meet-bionode/) with more photos and brief overview, and will be making that into a tech series. I'm looking forward to actually rolling it out of the lab for show 'n tell at a conference... that first step is always the big one!",

    "selftext": "My \"lab\" consists of 2 segments, \"production\" and \"sandbox/testing\". I got bored and scored an awesome deal on an older USG-Pro-4 for cheap w/ some cosmetic damage, so I opted to transition to unifi off some of my aging and power hungry Cisco hardware. So the hunt started for the basics, and with some of the basics acquired setup began\n\nNot a fan of the whole Unifi UI but it does make configuration and deployment MUCH faster, after resetting everything and adopting it went quick, and everything was configured in a couple hours. \n\nBut since im making the migration I figured it was a good time to clean up the cable management and re-organize the mess from adding and removing hardware for the last 2 years as my network and needs grew.\n\nI have noticed slightly better throughput on the network(probably due to more capable hardware) and I am now prepped to take on the fiber deployment coming to my area \"Soon(tm)\" (ISP doing 1gb free upgrade w/ support for 10g[unavailable at launch]).\n\nFor less than $150 for Ubiquity hardware (Gateway, 8port switch w/ 4POE, 5port mini and a AC PRO AP) I cant complain. Was able to wire 90% of the devices intented before I ran out of ethernet cable, was able to relocate AP for better home coverage and utilize my old \"AIO\" for experimental long range. \n\nFor only having less than $500 in the entire project I cant complain. I have quite the little robust setup for \"production\" Don't sleep on Optiplexes and Brocade hardware if you see it in the wild too. Spent the last 5 years dabbling after being out of it for almost 2 decades im pretty happy with what I got. Everything is 2nd hand outside of a few drives I replaced due to failing HDDs.\n\nUnfortunately the \"lab/sandbox\" is a mess tucked in a closet. \n\nP.s. I know the USG and 8 port aren't level. Thats what you get with junk laying around an old af entertainment center for CRTs and about half a 30rack deep and poor decisions. \n\nMoral of the story. Don't sleep on dated, \"untested\", dinged/damaged, cheap hardware and dont jump on the first thing you see better deals may come along.\n\nThe itemized cost of what I have invested in \"production\" environment including shipping where applicable\n\nUSG PRO: $45.78 -\"cosmetic damage\" (bent rack ears fixed w/ vice and hammer)\n8 Port: $25.88 \n5 port mini: $25\nAP AC PRO: $26.18 - \"pulled  from working environment no POE injector\"\nCabling: maybe $50 excluding what I already had in a spool given to me\nOptiplex1: $15 - parts only/untested/no drive 8gb ram\nOptiplex2: $25 - parts only/untested/no drive 8gb ram\nOptiplex3 : $50 - parts only/untested/no drive 8gb ram\n32gb ram upgrade: $50\nBrocade switch: $15\nConsole cable: $10\nUPS: free\nPDU: $10\nSSD replacement x2: $92.10 - NIB second hand - boot drives\n1x DOA Optiplex: $25 - parts only/untested/no drive 8gb ram\n\nEven with my adding in the costs of old hardware and testing \"rack\" I still have less than 750 in the project. \n\nSo this hobby can be done on a tight budget over time. As my \"needs\" grew so did my network. \n\nAnd if there's 1 key price of advice I could give. Its plan ahead, especially for network gear. Don't be afraid to grab a piece of gear if youre not gonna use it right away, or keep for a spare. ",

    "selftext": "i just recently got into 3d-printing and noticed most were using 10-inch racks since you can print full-sized 10-inch trays in a regular-sized 3d printer, but... i already had a 19-inch rack... so i figured i'd make some custom rails that allowed me to put a DIY 10-inch rack inside my 19-inch rack!\n\nmy switch and patch panel setup are a little unorthodox as well. this house didn't come wired for ethernet but it had phone line so i replaced all the jacks with rj45 but the already-ran cables didn't leave any slack to reach my rack. they just terminated directly in the box on the wall. so i mounted my switch next to the box so the cables would reach (please ignore the rat's nest of wires, i'll clean it up eventually). \n\nthe patch-panel that's in rack actually runs to all the devices on the shelf above it. 6-ports go to to my protectli machine that's a proxmox node with a pfsense vm (it's my internet gateway and manages all the VLANs), 5 ports go to the back of my netgear orbi for my wireless network, and 2 go to my synology NAS. then the switch drops a few cables that connect to the appropriate ports in the patch panel for the devices. i don't know how unusual that is but it made sense to me, lol\n\nas for as the 10-inch rack it has another protectli device that has another proxmox node. so it's plugged directly into the gateway device for managing the proxmox cluster as well as another cable to the gateway that provides an internet gateway for my kubernetes cluster. the kubernetes cluster is on all the PoE raspberry PIs (one raspberry pi 5 and three raspberry pi 4 model B) while the small protectli also has a vm on it which acts as a load balancer to the cluster.\n\nif you want more pictures, makerworld links to all the parts i made, or to make your own 10-inch rack rails for a 19-inch rack i put links and the rail DXF files up on my website: [https://www.richsnapp.com/blog/2025/06-30-a-10-inch-server-rack-in-a-19-inch-server-rack](https://www.richsnapp.com/blog/2025/06-30-a-10-inch-server-rack-in-a-19-inch-server-rack) \n\nhere's a sendcutsend shopping cart if you just want to order the rails as-is and have them custom fabricated for you: [https://cart.sendcutsend.com/rgwybjul7tez](https://cart.sendcutsend.com/rgwybjul7tez)",

    "selftext": "Hey r/homelab,\n\nExcited to finally share that the core of my new homelab server, \"Zeus,\" is up and running! I've successfully installed Proxmox VE and managed to get all the initial configurations sorted, including verifying ECC RAM. It's been a journey of learning, especially with a few initial hiccups, but I'm thrilled to have it powered on.\n\n**Current Core System Specs (Running on Proxmox VE):**\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 9700X (8C/16T, Zen 5)\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS PRIME B650M-A WIFI II (micro-ATX, AM5)\n* **RAM:** 64GB (2x 32GB) Kingston Server Premier DDR5 ECC 5600MHz (ECC verified working!)\n* **Boot/VM Storage:** 2TB Samsung 990 Pro NVMe SSD (PCIe 4.0)\n* **L2ARC Cache (for future TrueNAS):** 1TB Samsung 990 Pro NVMe SSD (PCIe 4.0)\n* **PSU:** Corsair SF750 Platinum (750W, SFX, Fully Modular)\n* **CPU Cooler:** Noctua NH-L9a-AM5\n* **NIC:** x550-t2 Dual Port 10Gbe Lan\n* **OS:** Proxmox VE 8.x\n\n**Past Mistakes & Lessons Learned (Don't be me!):**\n\nInitially, I made some less-than-ideal purchases which led to delays and extra costs:\n\n* **Motherboard:** I actually **bought an MSI B650M Mortar**, but after further research and compatibility considerations (especially for ECC and IOMMU on AM5), I decided to switch to the **ASUS PRIME B650M-A WIFI II**. The ASUS board proved to be excellent value, solid for ECC, and worked well for IOMMU/passthrough (once I got the GPU in!).\n* **PSU Form Factor:** Tried to fit an ATX power supply. Learned the hard way that SFX is crucial for compact server cases like the Jonsbo series. The Corsair SF750 is a godsend.\n* **Case Confusion:** I **bought the Jonsbo N3, thinking it would fit my micro-ATX motherboard, but it doesn't!** (The N3 only supports Mini-ITX). I then realized the Jonsbo N4's improved cooling and drive bay layout (6x hot-swap 3.5\") was much better suited for my storage goals, leading me to switch.\n\n**Waiting on These Final Pieces:**\n\n* **Case:** Jonsbo N4\n* **GPU:** NVIDIA Quadro T600\n* **HBA:** LSI SAS 9211-8i\n* **Storage Drives:** 4x 16TB Seagate IronWolf Pro (for a TrueNAS SCALE RAIDZ2 pool)\n\nOnce everything arrives and is assembled in the N4, the plan is to virtualize TrueNAS SCALE, OPNsense, and a few other services (Plex, Immich, Home Assistant, etc.).\n\n**Questions for the** r/homelab **community**:\n\n* Any general tips for managing a Proxmox host with a 10GbE NIC and PCI passthrough (once the X550-T2 is in)?\n* For those with similar Ryzen/DDR5 ECC setups, any specific Proxmox tunings you'd recommend?\n* What are your must-have containers/VMs that elevate your homelab experience?\n\nThanks for any suggestions and feedback! I'm really excited about this build.",

This is the default and most common approach.\n\nYou can connect the TrueNAS SCALE VM's virtual NIC to vmbr0 (or vmbr1 if you create a dedicated storage network bridge) to max use the 10GbE.\n\nIf your entire 10GbE network (host, switch, other endpoints like clients or another NAS) supports it, enabling Jumbo Frames (MTU 9000) can reduce CPU overhead and improve throughput for NAS operations.",

        "body": "My son has started a small custom PC build business and has been using Grok AI with great success for parts. For example.. inputting “Working with a $350 budget what’s the best power efficient home personal server setup with ECC ram for 10 docker containers, 2 database servers. Like to remain within 10-15W idle.” \n\nThat provides:\n\n1. CPU: Intel Core i3-9100 or i3-9100T ($50-$70 used)  \n   - Why: The i3-9100 (65W TDP) or i3-9100T (35W TDP) supports ECC RAM (unbuffered) and is known for low idle power consumption (~5-10W for the CPU alone in optimized setups). The 4-core/4-thread configuration is sufficient for 10 Docker containers and 2 lightweight database servers (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL). The i3-9100T is preferable for lower power but slightly pricier; the i3-9100 is more common on the used market.  \n   - Power Impact: Contributes ~5-7W at idle with proper BIOS tuning (C-States enabled, ASPM set to L1).  \n   - Source: Noted for low idle power and ECC support in multiple home server builds.\n\n2. Motherboard: ASRock H310CM-HDV/M.2 or ASUS P11C-M/4L ($80-$100 used)  \n   - Why: These Micro-ATX motherboards support 8th/9th-gen Intel CPUs (LGA1151) and unbuffered ECC DDR4 RAM. The ASRock H310CM-HDV/M.2 is affordable, has 4 SATA ports for storage, and an M.2 slot for an NVMe SSD. The ASUS P11C-M/4L is a server-grade option with better ECC support and multiple NICs, ideal for Docker networking. Both can achieve low idle power with BIOS optimizations (enable C8/C10 C-States, disable unnecessary peripherals).  \n   - Power Impact: ~3-5W at idle with optimized settings.  \n   - Source: Recommended for low-power ECC builds.\n\n3. RAM: 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 ECC Unbuffered (UDIMM) ($50-$60 used)  \n   - Why: 16GB ECC RAM is sufficient for 10 Docker containers and 2 database servers, assuming lightweight databases (e.g., MySQL with moderate workloads). ECC prevents data corruption, critical for database integrity. Use single-rank (1Rx8) UDIMMs to minimize power draw. Avoid filling all DIMM slots to reduce power (~0.5W per stick).  \n   - Power Impact: ~2-3W for 2x8GB ECC DDR4.  \n   - Source: ECC RAM benefits for servers noted in\n\n4. Storage: 500GB Samsung 970 EVO NVMe SSD ($50-$60 used)  \n   - Why: An NVMe SSD for OS and container storage minimizes power consumption compared to HDDs, which add ~5-10W per drive at idle. 500GB is ample for Docker images, database files, and OS (e.g., Ubuntu Server or Proxmox). Samsung SSDs are noted for low idle power (~0.1-0.3W). If more storage is needed, add 1-2 low-power 2.5\" HDDs (e.g., WD Red 2TB) later, but this may push power slightly above 15W.  \n   - Power Impact: ~0.3W at idle.  \n   - Source: SSDs recommended for low power in\n\n5. Power Supply: PicoPSU-90 with 60-90W 12V DC Power Brick ($30-$40)  \n   - Why: A PicoPSU is highly efficient for low-power builds, operating at peak efficiency even at 10-15W loads, unlike standard ATX PSUs (which lose efficiency below 20% load). Pair with a high-quality 12V DC brick (e.g., Leicke 60W). Ensure the brick supports peak loads (~50-60W during boot or high CPU usage).  \n   - Power Impact: ~1-2W overhead, enables 7-10W total system idle.  \n   - Source: PicoPSU praised for ultra-low-power setups.\n\n6. Case: Mini-ITX Case (e.g., InWin Chopin or Generic Mini-ITX) ($50-$60)  \n   - Why: A compact Mini-ITX case reduces power draw by minimizing fan needs. The InWin Chopin includes a 150W PSU, but we’ll use the PicoPSU for better efficiency. Ensure adequate airflow for passive cooling of the i3-9100/T.  \n   - Power Impact: Fanless or single low-RPM fan adds ~0-1W.  \n   - Source: Compact cases recommended for low-power builds.\n\n7. Cooling: Stock Intel Cooler or Low-Profile Noctua NH-L9i ($0-$40)  \n   - Why: The stock Intel cooler (included with CPU) is sufficient for the i3-9100/T’s low TDP. For silent operation, a Noctua NH-L9i adds ~$40 but ensures low noise and efficient cooling. Passive cooling is possible with good case airflow.  \n   - Power Impact: ~0-0.5W with a single low-RPM fan.  \n   - Source: Noctua coolers noted for low noise and efficiency.\n\n### Power Consumption Breakdown\n- CPU: 5-7W (i3-9100T optimized, C8/C10 states)  \n- Motherboard: 3-5W (with ASPM and BIOS tweaks)  \n- RAM: 2-3W (2x8GB ECC DDR4)  \n- SSD: 0.3W (NVMe idle)  \n- PSU: 1-2W (PicoPSU overhead)  \n- Cooling/Case: 0-1W (fanless or single low-RPM fan)  \n- Total Idle: ~11-14W  \nThis fits within the 10-15W target, assuming no spinning HDDs and optimized BIOS settings (e.g., enable deep C-States, disable unused ports like audio or extra USB).\n\nSoftware Recommendations\n- OS: Proxmox VE or Ubuntu Server. Proxmox is ideal for managing Docker containers and VMs for databases, with low overhead. Ubuntu Server is lightweight and Docker-friendly.  \n- Docker Setup: Use Docker Compose for the 10 containers, allocating ~1-2GB RAM total for lightweight services (e.g., Pi-hole, Nextcloud).  \n- Database Servers: Run MySQL/PostgreSQL in separate containers or lightweight VMs, allocating ~2-4GB RAM each. Optimize database configurations to minimize CPU usage.  \n- Power Tuning: Install PowerTOP on Linux to monitor and optimize power usage (e.g., enable HDD spindown, tune CPU governor to powersave).\n\nBudget Breakdown\n- CPU: $50-$70  \n- Motherboard: $80-$100  \n- RAM: $50-$60  \n- SSD: $50-$60  \n- PSU: $30-$40  \n- Case: $50-$60  \n- Cooling: $0-$40 (stock or Noctua)  \n- Total: $310-$350  \n\nChallenges and Trade-offs\n- Budget Constraint: Staying under $350 requires used components (e.g., eBay for CPU, RAM, motherboard). New parts may push costs to $400+, especially for ECC RAM.  \n- Power Target: Achieving 10-15W idle is feasible without HDDs, but adding even one 3.5\" HDD (e.g., WD Red) adds ~5-10W at idle unless spun down. If mass storage is critical, consider 2.5\" HDDs or external USB drives with spindown enabled.  \n- ECC RAM Availability: Unbuffered ECC DDR4 is pricier than non-ECC and harder to find used. Ensure compatibility with the motherboard (check QVL lists).  \n- Performance: The i3-9100/T handles the workload but may struggle if databases are write-heavy or containers are resource-intensive. Monitor CPU usage and upgrade to an i5-9400 or Xeon E-2100 series if needed (though this increases power and cost).",

I looked at SBCs from ODroid, various ones on Amazon, etc before deciding to build my own thing.\n\nIntel's official site also lists \"No\" for \"Supports ECC RAM\"  for all the processors in that series. Frustrating as it feels like they're basically just segmenting the market, but it's probably for cost reasons. I kinda get it.\n\nThe best I could find is that ODroid H4 supports \"in-band\" ECC with normal DDR5 RAM sticks, which is better than nothing, but isn't the same as having true ECC RAM.\n\nFor something like password storage, I could probably get away with in-band ECC or no ECC at all since there are very few writes and a lot of reads, but I am treating it like an insurance policy. Some of the data I'm working with beyond just the passwords is quite critical.\n\nThank you for the advice on the cooler and the PicoPSU offer!

I set my RHEL server up as a Samba (file) server, but began thinking of how I might make more virtualization servers (using Proxmox?), as well as what those server should even be, from either a learning/ home lab or household  perspective. One server should undoubtedly be a domain controller (setting up a proper domain), which I'm guessing that if there had to be one OS that must be Windows (server) based? It would undoubtedly have to be that domain server.\n\nAlso? Which servers (if any) would be best kept physical versus virtual? Since my Samba has 7TB dedicated to the share, would that be best kept physical for disk capacity and backup reasoning?\n\nThanks! I'm trying to grow my skill-set and preferring to keep things as Linux-based as possible, while also trying to be somewhat realistic about my setup and keeping close(ish) to the enterprise environment.for the experience. Another idea was an Ansible server, which I have absolutely no knowledge about lol\n ",

I don't remember if all T5810's offered dual CPU or not but I wasn't aware of the platform's limitation when I started and so wasted $$$ instead of just going for a better platform.\n\nThe T7910 has a larger case, supports 4x 3.5\" HDD's natively (another 4x 2.5\" HDD's with a Dell/Icydock cage in the 5.25\" bay), with dual CPU installed you get +16x DDR4 slots and +2 full x16 slots that each support at least down to x4/x4/x4/x4 bifurcation (handy for those cheap 4x M.2 NVME adapter cards). I haven't figured out how to boot from NVME (strongly suspect it requires Dell's $$$$ adapter card) but sata SSD is fast enough after waiting for POST to complete and all 4 NVME drives are detected at x4 from a single x16 slot. \n\nAlso, I believe it was common for the T5810's to come with a 485w PSU. That amazing rating is on 230v, not 120v. I no longer have the 485w unit to ask but both of my 1.3KW units are nerfed to just 1KW on North America's 120v power grid. I tried upgrading mine to around 600w and still ran into PSU safety shutdowns because of the idiotic multi-rail system Dell implemented. 100% happier for everything with the T7910.\n\nIMO Get a T7910 with a single CPU instead just for the available upgrade paths, be it HDD's, NVME, GPU, RAM and/or CPU.",

Gigabyte MZ32-AR0 Rev3.0\n2. AMD EPYC 7C13\n3. 16x 32GB 3200MHz RAM (512GB total)\n\nFor about 2.247€ (probably can try to bring it a bit lower? it accepts negotiations) from China; it costs a bit more than the single components probably but I hope it would be compatible out of the box and working given I'm taking said bundle with everything \"brain\" related.\n\nI already have my old PC case (a full tower) that I believe should be able to house the E-ATX motherboard, and I would get an 850W titanium PSU and two M.2 2TB SSD to put in mirror raid (via proxmox's ZFS) inside the system, maybe down the line more SSDs could be added (either via SATA or a daughter board for M2 drives in PCI-E), and a Corsair iCUE H170i for cooling the CPU.\n\nI am not really looking into any AI stuff or crazy speed network uplink or anything (the router/switch is an UDM Pro so it wouldn't really support more than 1GB anyways) of the sort, just local power to run a good bunch of VMs and containers for both the house (Home Assistant, NAS VM, Jellyfin and the likes) and labbing (DCs, Cisco stuffs, PNetlab, a firewall... Work things essentially). I do not plan to add anything more than maybe daughter carrier cards for M2 expansion and maybe one GPU for hardware transcoding (at least, at the moment).\n\nSO my questions... Sounds like a sound plan? Am I missing some amazing deal where with little more I get a better CPU (keep in mind power is kinda expensive here, so a funny quad socket system would quicky evaporate any saving in power consumption)? Missing something?\n\nThanks for your help/insight!",

Quickest way to check if it has an expander or not is to see how many sas cables are coming off the back plane. If you have 1 sas cable per 4 drive bays, it doesn't have a built in expander and you can pick up a cheap one for $20-30. I have Lenovo IBM 03x3834 16 Port 6 Gbps SAS SATA Expander. Sas2 is 6gbps. Thats gonna be your best bet. Happy hunting. \n\nHeres my build if you're looking for a good way to run these. https://www.reddit.com/u/noideawhatimdoing444/s/hkWwLEH0Gh",

Already having an electrician come by and install some power outlets for it.\n\nIm wanting to build a free standing room. Essentially 2×4s for framing, in a 3.5ft×4ft space, roughly 7 feet tall, plywood on the sides with a door. Insulated on the inside and use some sound deadening materials, and use a portable AC i have, venting the exhaust through the attic and out side. Also considering a small exhaust fan just to help create a negative pressure. \n\nI've done framing once a long time ago, but I figure for a small project it's not a huge deal. I wont be securing it to the ground or the existing unfinished walls, as I want to be able to just throw it away easily later in a few years.\n\nHas anyone done something similar? What tips do you have?",

        "body": "When I get my garage cleared out from the move I'm doing the same thing. Some thoughts I have on my project:\n\n1) Rather than framing it out, I'm just going to use 5 8x4 sheets of that 2\" pink foam insulation from Home Depot. The rack will sit parallel to a wall that I'm using as the last wall. I'm not really worried about heat leaking in through the slab or that last wall, because my AC unit can get rid of 5x more heat than my rack actually generates... so a little inefficiency is okay.\n\n2) This gives me an 8' tall, 8' long, 4' wide box, which is plenty of space for a full size rack and my portable AC unit, plus gives access to the front and back by just taking those panels off. Cost should be about $250 for the foam, plus a few bucks for tape to seal the roof to the side wall, and doors to the wall. I'm just going to use a bungee cord or something to hold the doors closed.\n\n3) I'm just going to vent the heat to the garage, which gets opened a couple of times per day and doesn't have anything else heat sensitive in it. I don't have a good way to get a vent to the attic with just the foam boards (without building it taller) and I can't go through the walls because the exterior is brick.\n\n4) The foam should deaden the noise enough as-is, so I'm not worrying about that. It's in the open garage already, so anything is better. Dust is similarly not a huge concern, I'll clean everything really well before sealing it up and then the igloo will only get opened when I replace gear.\n\n5) I'm purposefully having it a sealed box with no intake, because my portable AC is a hose-in-hose thing. That way I can keep the igloo a (relatively) chilly 75 or something and not have to continuously chill hot ass garage air. My AC has a built in thermostat so I'm just going to let it manage the temps.\n\n6) I'm putting in my own power outlets for this, just doing surface mount conduit from the box a few feet away. I'm going to run four dedicated 20A breakers (12/2 wire): two for the UPSes, one for the AC unit, and one for future whatever I guess. I considered going with 10/2 wire but that stuff is *significantly* more expensive. If I ever change my mind, it's all surface mount so it'd be easy to swap.\n\n7) Don't tell the inspector, but I'm not putting in GFCI/AFCI anywhere. If/when I move I'll replace them but I don't want to deal with them in the meantime.",

        "body": "depends on what you plan to run. I have two supermicros in my garage. running 2 years already. Here in south FL heat and humidity both probably are pushing to extreme. It's an attached garage and I have no AC nor dehumidifier. I have the fan in heavy io mode, quite loud. I can hear it on my drive way with garage door closed. But they work very well in the past two years. Recently I'm running local LLM and a lot of times the two servers together are pulling around 1000W.\n\nServer spec usually up to at least 35 and many can reach 40C and 90% humidity. Most likely you'll be fine. If you use consumer stuff it would be a different story.\n\nToday according to the weather report the humidity here is 84%.",

    "selftext": "**Hey r/homelab**,  \n\nI'm looking for a tool similar to **Lidarr** or **FileBot**—but specifically for **user-made or indie music**, especially stuff that’s been posted to platforms like:\n\n- **SoundCloud**\n- **Bandcamp**\n- **YouTube**  \n\nI’ve got a huge collection of downloaded tracks—some from the old internet days with random or gibberish filenames. I'd like to add them to my **Plex media server** or other personal music streaming setups, but it's been tedious trying to manually:\n\n- Identify the artist or title  \n- Clean up the metadata  \n- Organize it in a meaningful way  \n\nMost tools I've found only work with official releases or Discogs-level data. But I'm hoping there’s something out there that can help scrape or match indie or user-uploaded music.\n\nIf not, I might just be stuck with a long night of **Shazaming hundreds of files** 😅  \n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nLooking for software like **FileBot** but with support for identifying and tagging **user-generated music** from **SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and YouTube**. Bonus if it can automatically clean up file names and fetch metadata.\n\nAny suggestions? 🙏",

    "title": "ChatGPT helped me build my first homelab",
    "selftext": "Pictured, from bottom to top:\n\nLenovo RD450 - dual Xeon E5-2680v4, 224gb DDR4-2133 RDIMMs, about 40tb of used SAS drives across 2 pools\n\nall purpose Proxmox host with Docker in an LXC container, running Immich, Nextcloud, Netdata, PHP/Apache (hosting 2 sites), Minecraft servers using Amp, SearXNG, Fail2Ban, Crowdsec, Tailscale, and Cloudflare tunnels, and NUT connected to my UPS for safe shutdowns when power goes out. \n\nDell Compellent SC200 - used for periodic full redundant backups of the data on both servers\n\nDell r730xd - dual Xeon E5-2698v4, 512gb DDR4-2400 LRDIMMs, mix of SSD’s and 10k SAS hdd’s, all used\n\nbuilt solely for AI related projects and tinkering. NOT running 24/7. Running Proxmox/Docker. Still gathering funds for a quality gpu. \n\nTop of rack is just a patch panel and a switch. Not pictured is a Beelink mini-pc running Home Assistant. \n\nThis rack lives in my unfinished basement on 2 dedicated 20A circuits. Despite outdoor temps in the mid-90s F, basement has not exceeded 70 F.   Enterprise servers are beautiful to me, I was well aware of the noise, heat, and energy requirements. I planned accordingly. \n\nAll of the builds, updates, installs, testing, and troubleshooting were done with my personal ChatGPT instance holding my hand. I know VERY little about Linux, or most of the apps and services I’m running. I have 45 years of experience with computers, including software and hardware. But my experience is as a user, not the backend stuff. So, I had the base knowledge necessary to pull off using the VERY unreliable state of current AI. \n\nI document everything, every session, and I am learning as we have progressed. ChatGPT will hallucinate if a session goes too long, or you mix too many images or files into a session. It can, and often DOES, make horrible mistakes. You have to know enough about the subject matter to call it out on its bullshit. Nearly all LLM’s, but especially ChatGPT, are enthusiastic about their responses and will lie to your face with a virtual smile on theirs. \n\nI use my memory and saved documentation to ensure it’s got the best chance to be helpful. I require it to give me one step at a time, and await confirmation of success before moving to the next step. I forbid it from tail chasing. If it becomes clear it’s pulling answers out of its ass, we close out the session, undo whatever failed efforts have been done, and start over from scratch. \n\nI wanted a homelab to get me out of google, microsoft, and apple cloud storage. I wanted my own, ad-free self hosted search engine. I wanted to host 2 small, obscure sites. I wanted to play minecraft with my kids and friends. And i wanted to build a dedicated AI server to further my knowledge and creativity. So, i had a plan before I started. \n\nI established that plan with ChatGPT. I described what i wanted to achieve, what I already had, what I needed to buy, and what my current knowledge level was. It recommended the r730 platform to me. I already had the RD450 my cousin gave me from one of his sysadmin clients. \n\nEvery part, every purchase, every step has been in conjunction with ChatGPT. \n\nSo, that’s my story. I know it’s unusual, and certainly wasn’t a walk in the park. But, an element of why I chose this path was to PROVE that people don’t need to come here and risk criticism or ridicule. Most people here are kind and helpful. But every community has that portion of members who seem annoyed when not everyone is on their level. \n\nI usually browse the posts here because i like seeing other people’s gear. And i like learning about things i can incorporate on my server that i would otherwise never be aware of. I am however far too introverted and insecure to ask for help or guidance. Google is a lost cause in finding help. But AI is willing and able to help, 24/7, without judgement. And, occasionally without ANY clue what it’s talking about. 😅\n\nI know there are things I have done wrong, I am still looking for ways to better lock down security, but that’s a never ending struggle for people at all experience levels. I am currently building a box for OPNSense, to segregate network traffic and further secure things. I am grateful to this group for teaching me that such a thing existed. \n\nI’m in my mid-50s, too late in life to retrain as a sysadmin, cybersecurity expert, or network engineer. But i can learn as much as I’m able, and use ChatGPT to fill in the blanks. ",

Hey I understand them completely, I recently lost my job to AI. But I decided to use AI to MY advantage, I'll fight fire with fire. I saved hundreds of bucks using ChatGPT as a fancy web search tool, which is something it is better at than logical analysis. I just used it to search for optimal results and prove it with a verifiable link to everything. I'll do the analysis so I can verify it's not hallucinating.",

I will tell you now though: you will almost certainly underestimate how much rack space you actually need. I have a half rack (21U), and there's only 3U of space left in it right now. I'm actively avoiding putting anything in it in case I want to buy a DAS to increase the storage space in my NAS. It's easy to convince yourself you won't need more space, but as you think of more stuff you want to try, it'll grow.\n\nAlso, take measurements. Just about everything you've listed isn't actually rackmount hardware. 1U of space is 1.75\", just under 19\" wide, and depth will depend on the type of rack you want. With stuff that isn't actually designed to be in a rack, you'll usually want additional space above it to allow for airflow, especially if you're thinking of an enclosed rack. You are almost certainly underestimating how much space you'll need if you think 6U is enough for what you've listed.",

For example, an EPYC 7443P with 24 cores will run you about 600€ ( [https://geizhals.de/amd-epyc-7443p-100-000000342-a2492312.html?hloc=at&hloc=de](https://geizhals.de/amd-epyc-7443p-100-000000342-a2492312.html?hloc=at&hloc=de) ), then you'd need that 8TB HDD for about 160€ ( [https://geizhals.de/seagate-exos-e-7e10-8tb-st8000nm017b-a2625887.html?hloc=at&hloc=de](https://geizhals.de/seagate-exos-e-7e10-8tb-st8000nm017b-a2625887.html?hloc=at&hloc=de) ), the mainboard for about 720€ ( [https://geizhals.de/asrock-rack-romed8-2t-bcm-a2911096.html?hloc=at&hloc=de](https://geizhals.de/asrock-rack-romed8-2t-bcm-a2911096.html?hloc=at&hloc=de) ), then the SSD would run you about 250€ ( [https://geizhals.de/samsung-ssd-990-evo-plus-4tb-mz-v9s4t0bw-mz-v9s4t0b-a3316847.html?hloc=at&hloc=de](https://geizhals.de/samsung-ssd-990-evo-plus-4tb-mz-v9s4t0bw-mz-v9s4t0b-a3316847.html?hloc=at&hloc=de) ), you'd need a PSU for about 120€ ( [https://geizhals.de/fsp-vita-gm-1000w-atx-3-1-vita-1000gm-ppa10a4002-a3170035.html?hloc=at&hloc=de](https://geizhals.de/fsp-vita-gm-1000w-atx-3-1-vita-1000gm-ppa10a4002-a3170035.html?hloc=at&hloc=de) ), a chassis, which you can just use an old PC case for, and if you don't have one, you can get a cheap ATX case for less than 50€. The only thing missing should be the GPU. Plus a cooler for about 50€ ( [https://geizhals.de/arctic-freezer-4u-m-rev-2-acfre00133b-a3408117.html?hloc=at&hloc=de](https://geizhals.de/arctic-freezer-4u-m-rev-2-acfre00133b-a3408117.html?hloc=at&hloc=de) ).\n\nThat's 280€ + 600€ + 160€ + 720€ + 250€ + 120€ + 50€ + 50€ = 2.230€, which is more or less half the price, albeit without the GPU. But I feel like, getting a good deal on a consumer GPU with a bit of VRAM is probably cheaper than that Quadro RTX 6000, at least what the reseller charges for it. And you have to remember, this isn't Ada Lovelace generation, so it'll be the same architecture as the NVIDIA RTX 2000 consumer GPUs. GRanted, it does have 24GB of VRAM, so you'll probably need something like a used 3090 to replace it, which have been becoming very expensive since the RTX 5000 series is such a scam and people are buying these used GPUs off he market. So in actuality, you might really get that that Quadro RTX 6000. but even then. That'll run you about another 1.200€ used. Which in total it comes up to about 3.500, which has more CPU cores, better CPU cores, independent (as in non-OEM) hardware and is cheaper. But all in all, it is up to you.",

So make sure that it runs in your basement or something like that.\n\nAssuming this is a \"Huge Enterprise\" Server, which is actually not the case. In reality, we're talking about an HP Z8 Workstation with dual CPUs and a GPU.\n\nThe GPU is probably a bit overkill, but on the other hand, most models won't run properly on less memory. I'd say do some research on the price to performance ratio of the card. \n\nThe argument that this is overpowered still somewhat stands, dual Gold CPUs are no joke - my DL380/CL2200 Gen10s use somewhere around 120-200W under reasonable load. And reasonable load means >20VMs and 1-2 kubernetes clusters (Openshift). Under heavy load (CI/CD builds for example) I'd expect more. Also after bootup those aren't much louder than a typical cheap household fan (if you don't do unsupported stuff).",

The UGREEN is a nice starting point if you are looking to just 'set it and forget it' with some bolt on capability. If you cost isn't a big thing going with something like the Synology can be beneficial because of how much it can do out of the box.\n\nSetting up TrueNAS could be a great starting point to 'find out' how much you might *need* a NAS to host what you want. \n\nYou can always upgrade, replace, or expand with these things (the ease of these things is what sold me on a Synology later when I ended up expanding but I had started out with a small TrueNAS setup as well.)",

All other settings are even higher, which is *very* loud.\n\nBut with the IPMI tool, you can instruct the BMC to lower than fans all the way to their lowest setting and keep i there (though I found 9% was just as quiet to my ears, so set that as the floor) - but then you basically have to manage them manually, watching the temperature yourself in a loop and ramping the fans up and down.\n\nBut... keeping the CPUs cool with just the passive heatsinks was a loosing battle against noise, with two CPUs.  It works fine on my smaller supermicro \"fattwin\" nodes where I had only a single CPU and a very narrow case for airflow, but the larger case I had to put dedicated CPU coolers with fans on them.  Noctua makes great ones that fit the xeons, but there are two different mountings - normal and narrow - so make sure you get the correct one.\n\nA lot of the case is designed assuming air flow - you'll see temperatures for the power supplies and everything being monitored, and these can get quite high if the airflow isn't sufficient.  So it can take some experimentation to find the right balance between temps and noise.\n\nAnd if the CPU is very busy, well... it's going to be loud.  These cases just aren't designed to be quiet.  Sturdy as all hell and long running, yes.  But not quiet.",

After swapping out the stock 80mm with supposedly quieter ones, it still screamed. I ended up completely removing the fan wall and replacing it with 3x140mm Noctua industrial fans that spin at 3000 RPM. The fans are mounted with 3D printed brackets and slide in like a glove. I put grills on both sides to keep any wires out of the way. CPU temps are fine as long as you have active cooling on at least your rear CPU (if you have 2). Originally I had 2xE5 V2’s in it. Drive temps can be slightly higher than with the stock fan wall, but I haven’t seen anything outside manufacturer recommended operating temps.\n\nJust recently swapped out the dual E5’s for a single AM5 Epyc in it now and it runs even cooler. The new AM5 Epyc’s run circles around the older E5’s btw.\n\nI probably have the files yet somewhere for the fan wall brackets if you’d like them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ebnl69rzs3af1.jpeg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61f6d21a2f3dcf56f66bdbfb5e3a097287980e6c",

    "title": "Keep or sell? What should I do with all these Intel NUCs and desktop PCs?",
    "selftext": "I got the opportunity to take home a whole bunch of decommissioned office hardware from my job. Now I'm facing a decision on what to do with it:  \n- Option A: Sell everything and invest the proceeds into new homelab equipment.  \n- Option B: Sell the majority but keep a few of the best devices for my own homelab.  \nI'm not sure which path is wiser and would love to hear your thoughts.  \n\nThe Hardware Haul:  \nIt's a diverse mix, mostly Intel NUCs from various generations and two slightly more powerful desktop PCs.  \n\nIntel NUCs:  \n- 2x NUCs with Intel Core i5-1135G7, 256GB SSD, 1x 8GB RAM & 2.5GbE  \n- 5x NUCs with Intel Core i5-8259U, 256GB SSD, 1x 8GB RAM  \n- 4x NUCs with Intel Core i5-7200U, 256GB SSD, 1x 8GB RAM  \n- 1x NUC with Intel Core i3-7100U, 128GB SSD, 1x 8GB RAM  \n- 1x NUC with Intel Core i3-6100U, 128GB SSD, 1x 8GB RAM  \n\nDesktop PCs:  \n- 1x PC with Intel Core i7-8700 (RAM and storage are currently unknown, still need to open it up)  \n- 1x PC with Intel Core i7-7700 (RAM and storage are currently unknown, still need to open it up)  \n\nMy Current Setup & Context:  \n- Homeserver: A Ugreen NASync DXP4800 Plus running Unraid, with RAM upgraded to 16GB.  \n- Network: My entire home network is already running on 2.5 Gbps.  \n- Active UPS: An APC Back-UPS Pro 550VA.  \n- Unused UPS: A 19\" Fujitsu Smart-UPS X 1500VA, which is currently unused as I don't have a server rack. However, I'd like to buy a rack in the long run.  \n- External Services: I also have web hosting and a VPS with a provider. Almost everything that needs to be publicly accessible runs there quite affordably and reliably. My homelab is primarily for internal services that I access via Tailscale.  \n\nMy Thoughts and Questions for You:  \n\nOn the Topic of Selling:  \n- Prerequisite: For any devices I sell, I have to replace the SSDs with new ones (approx. $15 per unit) due to data privacy policies.  \n- The Upgrade Question: Is it worth upgrading the RAM from 8GB to 16GB (another $15 per unit) to offer better performance and get a higher price? Or is the profit margin too slim for that?  \n\nOn the Topic of Keeping Some:  \n- The Core Question: Does it make sense to use parts of this hardware for my homelab? My Unraid server is actually running just fine. The idea of setting up a Proxmox cluster is floating around in my head, but I'm unsure how useful that would be for me, since the services running on my Unraid server aren't exactly critical high-availability stuff.  \n- My Top Picks: If I were to keep anything, it would probably be the two 11th gen i5-NUCs because of the modern CPU and the matching 2.5GbE. Do you agree? But here too, the question arises: Can I find a meaningful use case, or is selling all the devices the best decision, and would it perhaps be more sensible to invest the money directly into other, new equipment?  \n\nI'm very interested in your assessments, food for thought, and maybe a few creative ideas that I haven't even considered yet.  \nThanks, everyone",

That way in future you have other friends to play with when you start having really crazy distributed cluster dreams\n\nI'm on the verge of fooling my brohter-in-law to join just so I will have an off-site backup destination in another city looool\n\nI dont use my homelab for anythign work or business related, its just for faffing about to satisfy my curiosity. But recently Ive been gettign really intrigued by LLM's (thanks to a 5090 upgrade for my PCVR simrig) but I wish my ex-office server boxes were big enough to host dual GPU's now. So maybe keep one of the big boxes just in case you get AI curious, its not unlikely to happen? I dont even know what Im going to do with local AI but in teh last few days of playing around with my new GPU I am already wishing I had more VRAM than a 5090's 32GB and asking myself am I really going to try justify buying 2x 3090's (or god forbid another 5090 one day in the distant future when they are languishing on the used market) just to play silly buggers upstairs with LLM's\n\nBut realistically you like your homelab and have it the way you want so theres no value in shoe-horning random junk in there. So sell it all and put it towards something you really want.",

That being said, if I didn't have a good small node lab set up they'd all be getting 2+TB of SSD, maxed out on ram, and be running ceph to get a pool going of that SSD and kubernetes by the end of the week.",

Start to migrate services from the Ugreen NASync DXP4800 Plus but keep it. It’s a decent NAS, and at 15watts TDP, it’ll serve up to the two nucs nicely. Then put 32gb on the desktop, add a decent GPU (3080 or AMD) and make it a decent gaming system & HTPC. Only fire that one up when you want to.",

    "title": "First home setup: NAS + Jellyfin + Home Assistant + UPS  (feedback appreciated)",
    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI'm finally putting together my first proper home setup after years of just dumping files on external drives and streaming from my PC. I'm aiming for something that can handle backups, media, and smart home stuff, and ideally grow with me over time. Would really appreciate any feedback... sorry if anything sounds weird, English is not my first language. I'm not putting product links because I don't want to violate any rules, but I'll name them properly.\n\nI’m based in Spain and planning to buy most of this during **Prime Day** or similar if Amazon were the case, so if you know any good EU sources or discounts, feel free to suggest!\n\nHere’s the plan so far:\n\nI’m going with a **Synology DS423+** for the NAS. If I understand correctly t’s a 4-bay model with enough headroom for Docker containers and light media server duties. I’ll start with two 4 or either 6 TB IronWolf drives: one for personal files like documents, photos, and videos (which I also back up to MEGA, encrypted with Cryptomator), and the other for my movie and series collection, which I want to stream via Jellyfin. I’m also adding a 500 GB SSD for apps (too much? too little?), Docker containers, and general system use.\n\nThe NAS will be **next to my router**, connected via **Ethernet**. I also have **Cat6A going directly to the TV and to whatever the streaming device will be**, so there's no Wi-Fi involved in media streaming or NAS access.\n\nFor playback and streaming, I'm considering the **Google TV 4K** — which I understand is an Android box — but I’m still open to suggestions if there are better alternatives. My current TV is technically “smart,” but very limited, and I don’t think it supports the Jellyfin app. So the idea is to install the Jellyfin client on the Android box and have it pull from the NAS over LAN.\n\nAs for networking: I have **fiber internet**, but I can’t remove the ISP-provided **fiber modem/router combo (ONT + router)**. So I plan to **set it to bridge mode** and handle everything else through a new, better router. Right now, I’m looking at the **Asus RT-AX88U Pro**, since I want something stable and future-proof that handles VLANs and offers good Wi-Fi 6 performance.\n\nTo deal with short power drops (I have solar + battery backup at home, but it takes 30–60 seconds to kick in), I’m planning to get a small UPS like the **APC BX700U-GR** to keep the NAS and router stable during those gaps.\n\nOne thing I’m still debating: are IronWolf HDDs the best choice for this kind of use? I'm not expecting heavy load, but I’d like them to be reliable and relatively quiet.\n\nAny feedback is welcome, but a few specific things I’m wondering:\n\n* Is 500 GB SSD enough for apps and Docker stuff like Jellyfin and Home Assistant?\n* Anyone here using the DS423+ for both media and smart home? Any limitations?\n* Better alternatives to Google TV 4K for Jellyfin?\n* Are IronWolf HDD drives the right pick here?\n* Thoughts on the Asus RT-AX88U Pro as a main router?\n* Any better places to buy this stuff in the EU during Prime Day?\n\nThanks in advance for reading — looking forward to your suggestions.

So I would honestly recommend higher capacity drives. Ideally look at the price per TB ratio and choose the best you are willing to afford. And you will probably also want to put these in a raid array so you don't loose any data if one of them fails.\n\nTbh I would recommend not using Synology but build your own NAS, for example with a Jonsbo case, mini-ITX mainboard (with an intel CPU 12th gen or later for AV1 decoding) and then just install FreeNAS on it. It will be cheaper and you will get a lot more bang for the buck.\n\n> One thing I’m still debating: are IronWolf HDDs the best choice for this kind of use? I'm not expecting heavy load, but I’d like them to be reliable and relatively quiet.\n\nLook at the noise ratings of different disks. I believe WD Red Plus were known for being pretty quiet.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I already have my hands full with setting up the network, NAS, Jellyfin, and Home Assistant and life in general, haha.

I’m looking for suggestions on what kind of hardware to start with (used mini PC? NAS? ThinkCentre? Intel NUC? Low-power vs future-proof?). I’m okay with tinkering but don’t want to overspend for no reason.\n* **Best practices for:**\n   * Structuring the container system\n   * Managing updates with NixOS + Docker\n   * Handling secrets, monitoring, and backups\n* **Any good solutions for:**\n   * Media/photo storage + iOS auto backup\n   * Home automation platforms that play nice with Docker/NixOS\n\n\n\nI’m not looking for full-blown enterprise setups—just something clean, hackable, and reliable that I can build up over time.\n\n\n\nAny advice, ideas, or architecture tips would be greatly appreciated!

    "title": "Building a Raspberry Pi Cluster - CAN Logger",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm building a Raspberry Pi cluster with at least 5 nodes, and each Pi will have the following setup:\n\n* A dedicated SSD\n* Two CAN modules (4 CAN channels per Pi)\n* Ethernet connection to allow centralized control from a host PC\n* Capability to log CAN messages and stream them to the PC\n* Real-time analysis and simulation of CAN traffic (send/receive)\n* Future expansion: control of Arduinos, cameras, UART modules, etc.\n\n**Current Setup:**  \nI have a working prototype (photo attached) running on a single Raspberry Pi, and it's performing quite well. The PC sends TCP strings that trigger Python functions on the Pi (e.g., logging, sending, or reading CAN messages).\n\nRight now, the system doesn’t send logs back to the PC yet (because I currently don't need it).  \nIt also isn’t built with real-time performance in mind, so there's no guarantee of low latency or synchronized actions.  \nAs the project grows, the current setup feels a bit fragile and may not scale well.  \nIn the future, I want to add real-time capabilities to reduce delays and keep all nodes in sync.\n\n**I have two main questions:**\n\n**1. PXE Boot:**  \nWould it be worthwhile to implement PXE/network boot for this cluster, assuming SSD/SD card cost isn't an issue?  \nAll nodes will run the same software stack at the core, and I'd prefer centralized management to simplify updates and maintain consistency—but there might be some differences in functionality between nodes.\n\n**2. Communication Architecture:**  \nI'm using raw TCP strings (previously I used serial commands through Bluetooth) to trigger Python functions on the Raspberry Pi. The Pi acts as a server, parses the incoming strings, and decides what actions to take based on their content. It works for now, but I'm not convinced it's the most efficient or reliable approach for executing commands.\n\nI’d really appreciate any input from those who’ve worked on Raspberry Pi clusters or similar systems.  \nThanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nMy company is regularly asked to erase hard drives for our customers, and often just handed bare drives.  What I was doing before was using a desktop computer with a SAS card in it and just sticking them on the bench while I ran a DBAN-like program, but we're trying to be a little neater and figured having a rack mounted server would be useful.\n\nOne of our customers was disposing of a ProLiant with 8x2.5\" SAS drive bays, so I stuck a LSI card in there (in HBA mode, so no RAID to worry about) and plugged the backplane cables into it - all good, I can connect via iLO and see the remote console and everything.\n\nBut I've never used very old HP servers that don't have the HTTP iLO.  This thing is old, like mid 2000s old, with DDR2 RAM.  I set an IP address for the IPMI, but I'm unsure how to actually access it.  There is an Ethernet port marked \"management\", but yet when I plug it into our switch, it doesn't ping.  Is that a serial RJ45 port like Cisco equipment has, not actually Ethernet?\n\nI'm going to try to update the BIOS on it to the latest one from 2011, but I doubt that's going to do much.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia this thing *might* have iLO 1.0, but I also am not sure how I'd find out.  Any suggestions?\n\nBasically all I need to be able to do is do a virtual KVM and view the progress of our disk erasing so I know when it's done.\n\nUnsurprisingly the built-in RAID card is a \"smart array\" E200 which does not support non-RAID configurations, so I'm going to remove that thing and put my second LSI SAS2008 card in instead.  Just need to re-run the cables, as this one does not use SFF8087 connectors like the newer ProLiant.",

Here’s What You Need to Know in 2025\n\nJust a quick correction if you’re working with the HP Z8 G4 and Xeon Silver 4214:\n\nYou might think it uses LGA 1151, but that’s not right. The 4214 is an Xeon Scalable chip, which means it runs on LGA 3647. That’s a server/workstation platform, not a consumer desktop one. The Z8’s HP 81C7 board supports this socket just fine, so you’re good there, just had the wrong socket type.\n\n# ✅ What the Xeon Silver 4214 Can Still Handle (2025):\n\nEven though it's not the fastest, it’s still solid for:\n\n* Office/admin work\n* Light CAD or media editing\n* Running dev tools or a few VMs\n* General multitasking and business apps\n\nBut yeah, it can feel sluggish with:\n\n* Heavy rendering\n* Multiple VMs\n* Scientific sims or demanding 3D work\n\nWhy? It’s a 12-core chip with low base clock (2.2 GHz), fine for background work, not ideal under pressure.\n\n# 🧠 Thinking of Upgrading?\n\nBefore jumping to a new CPU, ask yourself:\n\n* What’s your main workload - VMs, rendering, dev work, creative apps?\n* Are you actually running into slowdowns now?\n* Planning to scale up your work in the next year or two?\n\n# ⚠️ Also, CPU Isn’t Everything:\n\n* RAM: Got under 64GB? That’s probably holding you back too.\n* SSD: If you’re not on NVMe, you’re leaving speed on the table.\n* Dual CPU: Z8 supports it, adding a second 4214 or going dual Gold might be better than just swapping one chip.",

You should now be able to access local resources from any point on your network, and the internet. Unplug the cable between yours and Sky's routers and local resources should still work, as will DNS for local records (obviously not ones it needs to reach out for). If that doesn't work something is wrong but the issue isn't with the Sky equipment - troubleshoot as usual.\n\n  \nYou're treating the Sky router like a discrete xDSL/G.997.2/Docsis modem or fibre ONT, just that is has NAT, routing capability and (disabled) Wi-Fi.\n\nI ran a similar setup with the Sky Q router from 17-19. The only snag if you have Sky TV is occasionally they reprovision themselves to use their internal Wi-Fi rather than ethernet and connect to the router's Wi-Fi, even if it was turned off.",

Spinning drives too. It helps to replace the fans with new OEM fans as often the fans themselves make a lot of bearing noise. Enabling Max Performance per Watt system profile and enabling in-system characterization and letting it run will do a lot towards making them a lot quieter. Having good PSU fans will also go a long ways - those can make a _lot_ of noise when they start to go bad. Repasting the CPUs will help, as well choosing a NDC with a lower power consumption.\n\nNow I have a bunch of other R630s come in with used fans and they are noticeably louder than my personal R630. It's just a matter of wear and tear and correct settings.\n\nThe HP DL380p Gen 8s also get fairly quiet at idle when set correctly.\n\nSome dells you can modify the fan speed through IPMI and slow the speed down quite a bit as long as you monitor temperatures. Most servers are designed to overly cool to ensure there's enough headroom for spikes and also to ensure longevity under constant load. Neither of those factors are as much of a concern for most homelabbers, as long as temps stay fairly reasonable.\n\nCase in point: an R630 is rated to operate in up to 35°C (95f) temps. The default fan curves are designed to be able to sufficiently cool the server at those upper ends of rated operating environments. A homelab will generally never see those temps, so you can slow those fans down a bit without harm, especially if you aren't running 100% load 24/7, and most won't be.",

Especially since CPU coolers in those are often passive and everything is crammed to the brink to optimize space so the fans need to be able to replace the whole inner volume of air a lot more often than on consumer/enthusiast stuff.",

You can beg. You can threaten it. You can play with IPMItool all day and all night long. iDRAC will not spin the fans down past where Dell told it to go.\n\nGenerally this is about 35%, but varies from model to model and configure to configuration. It might also take ambient air temperature into account, in which case blowing an AC into the server might get you a bit lower fan speed, and blowing a hair drier into the thing might have the opposite effect.\n\nI have had a case open with Dell, and they refused to budge on allowing owner/admin override to the curve in iDRAC.

        "body": "I'm building my own UPS/PDU system after having bought the GeekPi PDU. I did give up the idea of having the UPS/PDU live inside of the rack simply due to the space required for the battery capacity I wanted. I built a 25Ah 12.8v LFP battery. In theory, you could fit everything within a 10\" wide but deeper box. My rack lives inside a utility rack/shelf so I'm just adding a shelf for the UPS/PDU box.\n\nBrief overview of my solution, this could be made more or less complex depending on your needs or abilities.\n\n1. Single 120v input (so one cord to the wall) with a Tasmota power-metering outlet.\n2. 2 surge-protected 120v output ports.\n3. 4S 25Ah 12.8v LFP battery with BMS.\n4. Trickle charger for the battery.\n5. 1000w pure sine inverter\n6. Transfer switch for near-instant swap to inverter power on wall power outage. I may incorporate a Tasmota outlet here to notify me when I'm pulling AC power from the inverter.\n7. Old Flex-ATX power supply I had on-hand will provide the 5v & 12v power.\n8. Multiple barrel-style ports (like the GeekPi unit) + USB-C PD (haven't figured out the PD part yet, may just gut an off the shelf PD charger)\n9. Various switches, ports, gauges, etc.\n\nI had originally ordered step-down transformers for 120v to 12v and 5v, but realized that using an off-the-shelf power supply would probably give me a more compact setup + less wiring complexity, and added reliability of an actual power supply vs. Chinesium converters.\n\nThe GeekPi PDU has a few limitations that I'm not a fan of.\n\n1. It's single voltage. Feed it with a 5-volt supply, you're getting 5v out of all 7 ports. For me, it would make the most sense to have two of them - one for 12v, one for 5v.. if it weren't for the overall 8-amp output limit.\n2. This is the dealbreaker for me: Each port's output is limited to 3A on paper, with a circuit breaker that will trip and reset (4 second delay) at 5A. The paper-limit for use with 5V supply is 15 watts per output, but only 40 watts total across all outputs. The official Raspberry Pi 5 power supply, for reference, is 27 watts. Granted, this is to allow for running high-powered peripherals and such....  but in my opinion, the limitations of this PDU make it a poor value proposition.\n\nHonestly, for something that just works with minimal effort, you could use an off-the-shelf UPS and PSU, then buy a 10\" blank panel. Drill out holes and install barrel connections. Wire them up to the 12v and 5v outputs of the power supply, and maybe add an on/off switch to it to control the power supply. You can definitely buy a blank, some barrel jacks, and a small power supply for the $50 cost of the GeekPi PDU.\n\nShare what you come up with!!\n\n  \nedit: I'm running 2 N100s boards (one with 4x HDDs, 2 NVME drives and the other with 1 NVME and a Google Coral), 2 Pi 3Bs, a cable modem, a switch, and an access point in my rack right now. I know my N100 with the HDDs is in the 35w neighborhood but haven't assessed the total usage yet. Assuming 100w constant, The 25Ah 12v battery should give me \\~3 hours of runtime. I will likely use the UART of the BMS or the Tasmota switch on the inverter output to trigger power-saving scripts. Shutting off Jellyfin/etc. and spinning down the HDDs would save 30 or more watts, which could increase backup runtime by another hour. Using the battery state, once at a certain threshold, I could shut off all non-necessary services to allow remote access to home-monitoring systems. My use case, aside from routine outages, is wildfire-related evacuations. I have air quality monitoring systems and flame detectors spread around. I have a separate NRF52-based Meshtastic system mounted above the roofline that I can get data from in a pinch, but it's not well-integrated yet. The last time I was evacuated for 5 days, it was a terrible feeling to have no idea if my house had burned down or not. Next time, at least I'll know whether or not it's happened.",

I have 2 Unifi AC-Lite APs from 2019 that cover the front and back of the house.  I have a basic 1 GB backbone and most data consumers (TVs, Cameras, Servers) are wired.   \n\nWireless devices are mostly phones, laptops, and IOT devices (IOT is on 2.4GHz).   I really don't NEED to upgrade for speed - of course MORE is usually BETTER - but I got over that a few decades ago.   So does anyone have any sage advice?",

        "body": ">when do you replace your APs that still work but are getting old?\n\nEntirely up to you. Factors in the decision may include:\n\n* Do the APs still get firmware updates? If not, are there known vulnerabilities or defects that were left unresolved by cessation of firmware development?\n* Do you have a lot of client devices that support wireless standards newer than what the APs support? Do you feel it hampers you? (For example, if you mostly use Wi-Fi to access the Internet, Wi-Fi faster than the Internet connection is pointless.)\n* Are you in a situation where congestion and/or interference make upgrades pointless?\n* Do you want to spend time and money doing the upgrades?\n\nHere's how I work through this in my situation. All my APs are running OpenWrt, so firmware upgrades will be coming as long as the APs meet minimum system requirements for OpenWrt (which in my case will probably persist for the rest of my natural life). I have no client devices that support BE and one that supports AX, so everything on my network is happy with AC. (Also, BE in OpenWrt is still a work in progress, with widespread support expected to arrive in early 2026.) I am in a heavily congested location, where no AP ever tested above 500 Mbps (in an unrelated development, 500 Mbps is also my Internet connection speed). So for me, the only upgrades I will be doing for the next few years are OpenWrt upgrades (incidentally, I upgraded my access points to 24.10.2 this past weekend)...",

I run allot of services to better my day-to-day, nothing overly critical.  Using Proxmox, Unraid, Docker and one bare metal pihole.  My practices in the early days were fast and loose.  Root everything, same password across the board, give all containers/vms/lxc root access to the host, etc.  As I learn and mature, I've been slowly building better practices and avoiding the obvious no-nos.  I still use some of my original vm/cts and tried my best to secure.  But there has to be a better way.  Is there an application I could run on the client (all linux) to basically perform a scan, looking for common issues and provide a report of security recommendations?  I had Wazah back in the day, but seemed to focus more on software updates rather than server configurations.  Thanks for any recommendations in advance.",

I'm having some trouble with a 3000 VA UPS model [Salicru SLC Twin RT](https://www.salicru.com/slc-twin-rt-1.html) that I purchased second hand.\n\nI installed it in December with 6x brand new batteries, and it has run fine until about a month ago (I just have one server connected drawing about 350-400 W). The UPS then started displaying errors and not being able to fully charge, so I disconnected it and tested the batteries.\n\nOne of them was shorted, and some others were only outputting 8-10 V, so I decided to replace them all, this time I bought more expensive Salicru official batteries. After less than one day running with the brand new batteries, the UPS is starting to fail again! I see the charge percentage decreasing, and the voltage of the batteries measured under load dropped to about 9 V (they don't seem to be charging even on bypass mode).\n\nIs the UPS unit faulty? To be honest, I'm starting to get tired of flaky batteries, monitoring and maintaining the UPS and unreliable service...\n\nWhat kind of UPS are you running, and have you come across issues like this? How often do you replace the batteries?\n\nThank you!",

    "selftext": "Situation, my main linux laptop which runs KDE can not work with my printer, a Dell C1760nw, which itself is a rebranded Xerox Phaser 6000. Printer is fantastic and ultra reliable, so I want to keep using it until it dies.\n\nSo I got to thinking, if nothing I can do on the KDE side can work with this printer, why not serve it out. In fact its already being served on my network from my windows 2019 server, but of course only my windows PC's can talk to it.\n\nSo perhaps I should go about getting it working a bit differently and install whatever linux OS IS compatible with the printer and just share it out that way. I have Proxmox so I can install any OS I like, I also use docker so if there is a container that works that would be great. In fact while I'm at it, if whatever service has smartphone compatibility (IOS & Android) that would be amazing. \n\nOne thing to note, is that when trying to connect my KDE OS to the printer, I can install it. It even shows the different levels of toner AND there is a driver for it. But when it comes time to print, the printer throws an error. The job does make it to the printer, but the printer doesn't know what to do with it. \n\nAny ideas would be fantastic.",

I would go with a Synology NAS for storage, if you want storage, and look at a cheap 'server' for software. You can pick up an EXTREMELY cheap mini PC with more CPU/RAM than Synology for less than $200 and you won't have to think about it again.

You're worried about data integrity but my advice was steered towards the mini being for compute, not for storage, meaning you'd probably only put 2 x 1TB (up to 2 x 4TB) NVME into it. Even with ZFS your RAM usage MIGHT be 16GB at the high end when doing some super big stuff, leaving you with 16GB for your VM's and the like. If we assume OP will be going for a standard Synology, he'll only have 2-4GB for the entire system anyway, so still way, way, way ahead for very little amount of $$.\n\n  \nI have only used HP EliteDesk 800 G5 Mini's, they go for $100AUD ($65US?) here, can have up to 64GB RAM, and have 3xNVME to utilise, they're beasty little critters that take up not much electricity.",

If say, my step son's laptop becomes infected with ransomware, at least it won't have a mapped network drive to follow to encrypt the data on the NAS.\n\nSo, for nextcloud, for example, it's accessible through the internet, but goes through a reverse proxy, so it goes like this:\n\nInternet --> Reverse Proxy --> Docker host --> Nextcloud container.\n\nThen I have a mount dedicated to nextcloud, that mounts to a share on my NAS, that's mounted using a service account with a very strong password. That share is only accessible to that service account. If my family needs to retrieve a file, they have to go through nextcloud, they cannot access the share directly.\n\nI do the same thing for all apps that require storage.\n\nMost people that start a homelab don't necessarily think about these things and, for most of them, it won't ever be a problem, but for some, they might get it with ransomware and get locked out of their data, or other threats out there.\n\nI just didn't want to take any chances.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm running into a frustrating SMB performance bottleneck that I haven't been able to trace, and I could really use some insight from the community.\n\n# 🖥️ Setup:\n\n* **Server:** TrueNAS SCALE (latest stable, unsure of exact version)\n* **Client:** Windows 11 Pro (fully updated)\n* **NICs:** Both machines have **Chelsio T6** 25GbE cards (connected directly, NIC-to-NIC)\n* **Jumbo Frames:** Enabled at 9000 MTU on both sides\n* **Protocol:** SMB3 over a standard share (no encryption or signing enabled manually)\n* **Storage:** 8 drives on RAIDZ1\n\n# ⚠️ The Problem:\n\nUntil about a week ago, I was getting **600MB/s sustained reads** over SMB, in any file, so I don't attribute this to a cached speed. Today, I'm **barely reaching 300MB/s**, even on large sequential file reads.\n\nHowever:\n\n* **FIO local tests on the server** still report \\~800MB/s (no drop)\n* **iperf3 over the NIC** still shows +1GB/s (no network bottleneck)\n* **No updates** were applied to either TrueNAS or Windows (to my knowledge)\n* No changes were made to the dataset or SMB share\n* SMB server service has been restarted; issue persists\n\n# 🧪 What I've tried:\n\n* Added `aio read size = 1` and `aio write size = 1` to the share's auxiliary SMB config via `midclt` (no effect)\n* Verified server is using `server signing = auto`\n* Disabled `EnableSecuritySignature` on Windows (`Set-SmbClientConfiguration`)\n* Verified `EnableMultichannel` is `True` on Windows\n* Disabled Defender’s real-time protection and added exclusions\n* Checked NIC power settings, buffer sizes, LSO/Offload options\n* Ensured the network profile is marked as **Private**\n* Rebooted both systems\n* Ran tests with `robocopy /J` to avoid Explorer limitations\n\n# 🧐 Observations:\n\n* CPU usage on TrueNAS doesn’t max out during transfer\n* Samba process doesn't appear saturated\n* No ZFS scrub or heavy I/O on the pool\n* ARC hit ratio remains high\n* There’s no clear fragmentation or degradation in the pool's health\n\n# 🤔 Theories:\n\n* Samba on Windows client may have degraded due to unknown internal state\n* Mullvad might have silently modified some adapter routing/firewall rules?\n* Windows 11 may have changed SMB negotiation behavior silently?\n* SMB Multichannel might not be kicking in properly",

As our university cluster is pretty big with many compute nodes and also dozens of people using it. There is at least one person I think which manages this more or less full time. So it might be a bit too bulky and complex for your limited group of users which probably also now and trust each other. At least the other one is the case at our cluster as well I guess.

I know on my current storage server running just on processor it like crashed and burned trying to run the project there. \n\n  \nI would love some thoughts on if its really possible, or if I really need to be using lower core / thread count processors to achieve the necessary performance. thank you so much to everyone who takes the time to give me some of their insight!",

    "title": "Pi4 - PiHole SSD Boot",
    "selftext": "Okay so... I'm new to homelabbing. I've a minor ubuntu server I'm using for funsies. I setup a pi hole to route things like [pihole.domain.com](http://pihole.domain.com) to ips for nginx to get https access to things, and all that stuff. I'm not certain I'm saying that right but it's relatively irrelevant to this topic.  \nAnyway, I got a rpi4 kit that and all that and set up pi hole on an sd card. Shortly thereafter, I realized that pihole does many small writes to the card and might fry the card in a short-ish amount of time. So my genius thought - SSD. I grabbed an SSD off of amazon with an enclosure, mounted it to my server with the pi, and rsynced everything over. After fixing up UUIDs and all that and getting the eeprom sorted to boot from SSD, I booted up the pi hole.  \nNow, it wasn't the most graceful of take offs. When I initially started it up, it had issues using commands I had previously used without problem (btop, etc). It was suggested I reload the apt lists and reinstall problematic things. So I did that. It worked until the next morning when I realized the pi was hanging. It wasn't routing DNS. It wasn't accepting SSH. It was powered on but unmanageable. So I rebooted it. Kernel panic. Reboot again and it came through fine. Clearly, something was up. I wiped the SSD and installed a fresh version of pi lite and got the following errors.\n\nError:\n\n    0.977256] mmc1: Controller never released inhibit bit(s).\n    32.019553] I/O error, dev sda, sector 250068776 op 0x0: (READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 21 prio class 0\n    [ [ 141.539155] xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: XHCI host controller not responding, assume dead\n    [141.5392911 xhci_hcd 0000:01:00.0: HC died; cleaning up\n    [141.5555181 Buffer 1/0 error on dev sda2, logical block 540608, async page read\n    [ 141.555664] Buffer 1/0 error on dev sdal, logical block 131057, async page read\n    [141.555854] Buffer 1/0 error on deu sdal, logical block 512, async page read\n    Error: Partition(s) 1, 2 on /dev/sda have been written, but we have been unable\n    to inforn the kernel of the change, probably because it they are in use. As a result, the old partition(s) will remain in use. You should reboot now before\n    making further changes. Ignore/Cancel?\n\nI'm not 100% certain what to make of that. Maybe I'm just being dense here. I'm inclined to believe it's either a power issue or an issue with the connection between the usb and the ssd? Regardless, I could use some guidance here.\n\nDevices:\n\n>Pi - Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Model B 8GB  \n\\- RPi OS Lite (64-Bit)  \nPSU - Geekworm Power Supply for Raspberry Pi 4, 20W 5V 4A USB C  \nSSD - Silicon Power 128GB SSD 3D NAND A55 SLC Cache  \nSSD Case - SABRENT 2.5 Inch SATA to USB 3.0 Tool Free External Hard Drive Enclosure\n\nThe only other thing I could think of is that putting the ssd into the ssd case wasn't perfectly smooth... It required slightly more force than I am comfortable with dealing with electronics. To be clear, I didn't bend anything. I didn't crack or break anything. It was just slightly concerning.",

There's a bit of a learning curve here and all it will probably feel foreign and unfamiliar at first, as you have no basis for comparison.  But it is necessary in the long run.  \n\nWeb server.  Just a regular Ubuntu server installation.  Apache comes default and is fine.  Some people prefer Nginx.  I happen to use Apache.  Install PHP.  Then start delving into installing Wordpress.  Don't go building entire web pages from scratch.  \n\nConsider buying a domain name.  It only costs like 15 bucks a year.  Point the dns to your IP address (you may have to consider using DDNS if your IP keeps changing -- I do not have a permanent IP address, but it also hasn't changed in all the years I've lived here, but that's hardly true for everyone)\n\nInstall Certbot (trivially simple to do).  It'll install legit web certificates so you can have https access to your sites, keeping them nice and secure.  \n\nNextcloud.  Download the AIO preassembled VM.  It is Ubuntu based.  You could install it via snap, but it lacks a number of features.  My recommendation, put that on it's own drive and let that VM take up the whole drive.  A lot of people try moving the data folder to somewhere else (such as an external drive), that always ends up being problematic.  Just leave it where it is and let the VM use the entire drive space.  \n\nLearn what a reverse proxy is.  As you now have a web server that you need to access from your IP/domain name as well as a Nextcloud server which has it's own integrated web server that you'll need to access from the same IP.  Reverse proxies are what directs traffic from [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) to one server and [nextcloud.example.com](http://nextcloud.example.com) to another.  \n\nIf you can get those three things running (proxmox, a web server, and a nextcloud server), that's a legit home network.  It's also well primed for further expansion as needed.  If you get the certs all installed, it'll also well secure (though there's still some loose ends to tidy up on the Apache server)",

Physical would only be a strict prior requirement if you're say, trying to work as some kind of higher end architect in a server farm, in which case you would already be pretty far into your career anyway.\n\n\nAlthough its old, I think \"packet tracer\" by Cisco is still one of the best pieces of software a homelabber can get. It simulates the routing stuff really well, but *also* includes things like plugging cables into actual ports, turning devices on/off, as well as options for different geographic locations. It's fantastic. Its just old and feels old. You can get the hang of it very quickly, though. \n\n\nThe only barrier is having to make a Cisco account, if I recall correctly. It's also obviously going to try and get you to (only) know Cisco products, but in terms of affordable (free!), intro material, it really is an excellent starting point. ",

You think we'll hire someone that's experienced. For an entry-level role.",

First of all, you are making some money but definitely not a lot (1000-1500€/month) so at the end of the day, the company has a cheap employee for lots of first level things. That's usually the classic route this whole thing takes - first year first level support, second year more advanced stuff, server administration, network administration, maybe some security stuff depending on how you fare.\n\nIdeally the company treats the apprentices so well that they stay afterwards so you have an employee who trained on the actual infrastructure so you have a lot of in-depth knowledge on how things are working together, etc.\n\nSchool is actually paid for by the state so there really are no downsides to hiring apprentices. But considering the aggressive \"Hire and fire\" corpo mentality in the US that I hear from something like that would probably not work because it requires the company to allocate some ressources for the training too - it's an investment into the future of that person who may become a valuable employee to the company. \n\nI did my training, am finished for half a year now and take responsibility over Network Administration tasks and endpoint security.

The processor is Atom E3940 (quad-core, 1.6 GHz, AES-NI support), so 500 Mbps with OpenVPN should be achievable as well...\n\nSophos retired the entire XG (and SG) lineup effective March 31, 2025, so XG (and SG) devices are available very inexpensively. There's no reason you can't get one for under USD 100...\n\nOPNsense installation on XG 115 Rev 3 is a breeze. It's not locked down in any way. No BIOS passwords, no bypasses, and no watchdogs. There's even an HDMI video output, so you don't have to use a console cable (but if you already have one, you can).",

But when i try to ping any device in my local network from outside, it doesnt work.\n\nAny tips for making this happen? ",

    "selftext": "Hi folks,  I am discovering a mysterious steel tank at the side of my recently purchased building….anyone seen this before and know what it could be?   It’s about 5’tall x 8’long x30”wide.  The 3 story apartment brick building was built in 1903 on the south side of Chicago.  And this tank was built on the side of the building…essentially blocking path of travel to get from the front yard to the backyard.  It was covered in sand and then bricked-in on both sides, with a thin layer of concrete on the top.  See photos below.   Any ideas would be greatly appreciated…cause I need to get rid of it in order to clear the path of travel",

YMMV.. ;) \n\nPS: Some folks blend heating oil, diesel, used motor oil, ATF, etc. into \"black diesel\". So if it isn't empty, you can almost certainly find someone on marketplace who will drill a hole in it and pump out the contents to take with them for just this purpose. I'm building a filtering setup right now for this purpose, and with diesel near $5/gal here, I'd bet you could find someone who'd empty it for free. Removing it is another story.",

    "selftext": "That vertical R730 is my current server with like 20TB of data on it. Finally got the new server (Cube in the closet) set up and ready to transfer everything over. Brought the Dell into the office since the only SFP+ cables I have are a few feet long. Thought the server was unplugged and went to pull a PCIE card and fried the iDRAC board and can't get the Dell to power up at all now. I did what any sane person would do and pulled another R730 from the garage and moved the drives over. Only reason I have this other server is because FedEx royally screwed the pooch on this one and it arrived so banged up they had to send me another and never bothered asking for the fucked up one back. Anyway, I cannot, for the life of me, get the new server to boot into procmox. If I made a fresh install of TrueNAS on the Dell, would it recognize the zpool? If I connected the 16 drives to the new server with a large enough HBA, would the zpool show up? Thankfully anything important on that server was backed up but boy would I like to avoid repopulating my plex server again. Any help would be appreciated and kudos if you made it to the end of this rant. ",

FedEx-damaged one..  and please don’t install it on any of those data drives, try using a USB drive or something separate.\n- then, connect the drives in the same slots if possible.. although, don’t worry too much.. ZFS is not slot-dependent for imports.\n- finally, do `zpool import` & if pool shows up, do `zpool import <poolname>` ..    also check the health `zpool status`\n\nThis is the best way to safely recover your data.. but, yeah.. before going through all this shit, try checking your BIOS settings or possible updates..",

Tidy cables (even during temporary troubleshooting) so you don't knock anything over or trip, add lighting so you can see better, unplug (not just switch off) when changing hardware, ensure tools and screws don't fall into the case, as capacitors still retain charge even when off.

Hot removing PCIe cards is perfectly fine, if you pull them out straight, and not at an angle, and the expectation is, that you aren’t using it, despite your OS thinking it’s still there. The PCIe host or switch may not support hotplug signaling, and the operating system may also not have support enabled, unless you’re using hot-plug U.2, U.3, or E1S drives in it, however. And even if you do short something on the PCIe bus, this should cause a system halt or trigger overcurrent protection on the motherboard, such that it disables that port and just that port until you reboot or power cycle the sustem. If that’s handled by a non-resettable SMD fuse, you’ll need to solder to replace it, but usually this is done with Polyfuses, and they just need to cool down and everything will work again.\nUnless you saw sparks or smelled the magic smoke, everything is probably still fine. Your iDRAC settings may have gotten wiped. That means it likely loaded its default settings and that’s why you may be thinking it’s broken because it’s not reachable over the network.\nRemoving power from all power supplies for 15 seconds might just get it back to normal.\nBut also, yes, you can just move all the drives of a ZFS pool to a new system and import the pool with a ZFS version that is equal or greater than what you were running before.",

It’s lucky you had a second R730 (even if FedEx unintentionally blessed you with it). To your question, yeah, if you do a fresh install of TrueNAS and connect the drives, it *should* recognise the existing zpool, assuming the pool wasn’t encrypted and the drives are all connected properly through a compatible HBA. Just be sure to import the pool rather than creating a new one when prompted. And yeah, if you move the HBA and all 16 drives into the new server and everything lines up, the pool should appear there too because TrueNAS is generally good about detecting existing pools. Glad to hear the critical stuff was backed up! Rebuilding Plex is always a pain, so fingers crossed for a smooth import. Happy to help troubleshoot further if you hit any snags.",

AMD GX-222GC has only two cores. Also, it has AMD-V (AMD analog of VT-x), but not AMD-Vi (AMD analog of VT-d, aka IOMMU), so you technically can virtualize things, but can't pass devices to VMs (the latter is a hard requirement for virtualizing TrueNAS; it needs low-level access to storage drives). \n\nBut TrueNAS won't run on this device even on bare metal. It needs 8 GB RAM and a set of three drives, a dedicated OS drive and at least two identically sized drives to make a storage pool.\n\nOpenMediaValut, on the other hand, will be very happy on this device, **if you deploy it on bare metal**. \n\nHere's what I'd like you to try. Install Debian on your device, then deploy NextCloud on top of it (note that NextCloud doesn't run in a vacuum; it needs two prerequisites, an HTTP server, usually Apache or nginx, with PHP enabled, and a database server, usually MySQL or MariaDB). Then come back and tell us your impression of its performance.  I am going to go out on a limb and predict that you are likely to be underwhelmed.",

Both the speed of the PCIe slot and that of the CPU will be limiting factors if you have to make it do IDS and/or VPN. As for Plex (but consider Jellyfin) be careful here too with the power of the CPU and GPU. However for experimenting with Proxmox it is perfect.\nLook at www.parkytowers.me.uk/thin/",

    "selftext": "TLDR: my only options are to use a reverse tunnel to a vps or open a port on my network for remote access with wire guard.  I ended up here because an iPhone cannot handle headscale/Tailscale as it doesn’t even give an option for self signed certificates with this setup.  So for those that know, which one is better or safer or easier to monitor and setup properly?  I am leaning towards opening a port because it’s free and doesn’t require setting up a vps.\n\nFirst of all ChatGPT is terrible when it comes to networking questions.  To quote a previous comment I saw “it’s more artificial than intelligence” but it’s my crutch because I do not work in IT.  I do not have time to take a class nor do I have any friends that work in IT that I can ask.\n\n…but… I have a really awesome homelab that I am proud of.\n\nWhere ChatGPT can be helpful is when it answers a questions just good enough for me to find the right answers or figure out the right answer from its wrong answer.\n\nBetween ChatGPT and the proxmox helper scripts available - it is kind of idiot proof for someone like me to be in a place I don’t belong.\n\nI would argue I am now proficient in all things homelab.  I have VLANs and firewall rules at the router level.  I have ufw rules at the vm/lxc level.  I have ACL rules for users and access.  I am still a novice on ssl and so I’m still very nervous about allowing outside access as I don’t know enough nor have time to monitor unless I can setup alerts like with fail2ban or other options out there.\n\nBefore I got here I was using the built in wireguard from UniFi until I segmented my networks as this cannot cross vlans.  I then used netbird but hated the idea of using someone else’s platform as that can get hacked and is probably a high target for being hacked.\n\nSo back to the topic, I see so many of you have nginx and authelia running.  Others wire guard.  I don’t use kubernetes so traefic isn’t useful for me.  I plan to continue to learn and grow so caddy is out as I only want to learn once and want to add more than one way in for different LXC’s.\n\nI don’t use docker as everything is a proxmox lxc which I know complicated my setup somewhat but I do have everything working properly locally and would love to have remote access for some things on my phone.  Thank you in advanced for any help/support/advice!",

Probing for that open port without knowing the your IP first would take a very, very long time. Wireguard uses UDP and does not respond to invalid packets, making this even harder even if the hacker used Shodan (a site indexes the whole web and find open ports).\n\nYou will have to be specifically targeted to be attacked to this extent. It's going to take hours to scan the whole port range in UDP. When you deploy that VPS, it's just gonna be harder for an outsider to attack because they have global firewall, but it might be easier for the attack to happen inside the datacenter network.",

For example, since I use Mikrotik as my main router, I have lots of scripts, including monitoring, failover, DDNS, etc. that is handled by Mikrotik. The documentation on their scripting language is terrible, but for some strange reason ChatGPT actually gets it right about 90% of the time. Deepseek is even better at getting the scripting right.\n\nAt this point, I don't even bother writing any code/provisioning scripts from scratch. I just tell ChatGPT what I want, it writes it, I do my additional edits and correction, and it works great.\n\nPeople should be super careful though. For example, I wanted to benchmark my drives using fio, and ChatGPT provided a command to run fio against the NVME device directly which will destroy the file system on the drive, but it did not offer any disclaimer. I knew that will be the case so I did not run it, but you should be extra careful with any commands from ChatGPT, especially if you do not know what you are doing. Always verify from other sources, and please for the love of God, if you are going to vibe code, at least know what you are doing.",

        "body": "I would love if someone with more knowledge than me can confirm the accuracy of what I am about to say... because the short answer is no.  The way packets travel are from peer-to-peer within the VPN tunnel require's a route.  So when on the LAN both endpoints are seen by your router/gateway.  When one endpoint goes offsite the endpoint dissappears from the router.  \n  \nTo my original post - having a vps take the place of what tailscales tailnet does, or what the netbird website does.  It is a public endpoint that's always active and online and available to reach.  Your local endpoint of the tunnel now reaches out directly to his endpoint and waits for someone to show up with the right encryption key.  Your mobile device reaches out to the same endpoints with the correct key and then gets routed properly.  Without this, your mobile device has no way to get back home.  The only alternative would be to open a port on your router and instead of reaching out to the vps/tailnet/netbird online gateways - your vpn reaches directly to your public IP address given to you by your internet service provider.  \n  \nI have also learned that pfsense is the only gateway that allows vlan routing from offsite devices.  So if your network is segmented and you are not using pfsense, trying to acces a vlan that is not on the main LAN network is not possible.  This is where having wiregaurd or tailscale setup come into play because you can port forward to a landing point off the main LAN and give that privledge to route properly.\n\nThis is in a nutshell the question in my post.  Tailnet and netbird rely on those being secure and up.  Opening a port relies on you getting your public ip address correct.\n\nHeadscale and Tailscale is the alternate to the above problem but I am not good enough yet at networking to get this working which would be the answer.  I may have to look back into this but would love a short term bandaid.",

        "body": "Firstly thank you for the reply, I started with a Cloudflare tunnel and then domains to access the containers & an email requsest code was required to access the tunnel. I then restricted it to only allow access to just my IP, but then..well I can't access that when I'm not at home. So I'd need a VPN.\n\nDecided it would be simpler to VPN into my home network and access the containers I wanted that way. I wanted to do Tailscale but I had some issues for some reason with exposing my containers, I spent a few hours troubleshooting (I 100% put that down to my inexperience).\n\nSo now I ended up with WG-Easy and Caddy & it works well! I currently turn it off when I'm home and only turn it on if I leave knowing I may need it.\n\nAs the original comment you talked about mentioned needing 51820 open and your comment was on not presenting public facing ports. Please do correct me if I'm wrong, is exposing this port still okay? My understanding was that as Wireguard is UDP and to get any reply they would need valid keys, without valid keys, the packet gets dropped, and no error messages are sent—nothing.\n\nI've also setup 2FA on my Wireguard. is there anything else I should be doing?\n\nIf this stills shows my lack of understanding, I can go back to the drawing board to better understand and keep it off for the moment.",

The only way to get close to the door is to enter the space with the right tunnel on the right platform (tailscale or wiregaurd)  and have the exactly correct public key and private key to be pulled back home.\n\nis this understanding accurate or close to accurate?

In order to access other stuff that is not on the same subnet, nor have the routes to, you will need the system to do the IP forwarding. \n\nNow, if you are trying to access a service at \"192.168.1.28:5000\", the connection tunneled by WG won't know about it, nor does it know how to access it (routes). Because the 'wgX' interface is not the interface which can access your internal subnet, it will have to ask the system to forward this request to, say, 'eth0' that is on \"192.168.1.0/24\".\n\nSo, you have options. 1. You can have 'iptables' on the Wireguard host to limit the communication between 'wgX' and 'eth0'. 2. You can set your router/firewall to block connections to specific hosts.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe all know that managing cables and accessories in server racks can be a real headache. Every rack and every layer has its own unique needs, yet most cable management solutions are inexplicably expensive, even for second-hand options. So I decided to do something about it.\n\nI've been developing a 3D-printable, modular system for 19-inch server racks that utilizes a hexagon (Bestagon) mounting interface. This design is specifically intended to accommodate up to C13 and C14 plugs, ensuring compatibility with common power connections and anything smaller\n\nThe system offers a modular way to mount a variety of accessories, and I've worked to minimize the need to buy parts – almost everything is printable.\n\nEverything snaps neatly into place for a clean, flush look, but can be easily disengaged when you need to reconfigure. I hate having to buy or print new mounting hardware just because you can't separate pieces without damaging them.\n\n**So far, I've developed:**\n\n* Velcro/Zip Tie Loop\n* Hard Plastic Loop\n* Cable Duct (front-to-back rack management)\n* Keystone Block\n* Key Hole Slot Pin\n* Cable Passthrough\n\n**Todo List;** \n\n* VGA female / female mount\n* Trial Octagon shape for more degrees of rotational freedom\n* Standard Hook\n* More traditional Comb for neater look with keystone plates\n\nI want to stress, Its still very early days. None of this is final.\n\nI'm keen to hear your thoughts. Is this something you'd be interested in printing for your rack?  \nWhat other accessories would you like to see added to the system?\n\nP.S.

Buying a standard desktop gives you tons of wiggle room for upgrades, and trust me, you'll want upgrades down the line as you play around more. \n\nHaving SATA ports, PCIE ports, m.2, etc. Offers SO MUCH ease of use that you absolutely will miss, and an older (8th gen) i7 PC can support so much more RAM than those other solutions at incredibly cheap prices. \n\nIf you are playing with VMs, you basically want as much RAM as you can pack.\n\nOnce you've got your processes down, got your stuff tightened up to what you want, etc, then jump in on a form factor upgrade that will fit all of those needs as determined by your testing.",

From there you can add more.\n\nFor context the prices I paid for rpi 5 4gb was around 6200 rupees and adding the power supply and sd card it was around 8500/.\nFor the thin clients or even office desktop I was quoted around 10000 to 15000. That's better price to perfomance but bad performance per watt.\n\nAlso a side not instead of buying from Amazon you can check out robocraze website directly, they are a lot cheaper and provide India wide shipping.",

Probably from one of many of my posts too. \n\n\nYou want a prebuild NAS like a Synology if you don't want to bother too much with this stuff, if you want a plug and play solution that even your cat could be able to setup. Synology is known to be extremely expensive, with very poor hardware, but with an amazing software, that can give you anything with a simple click. \n\nDIY would cost like 1/5 of a Synology, with 10 times more power, with the same or even lower power consumption. The key for low power consumption is using an Intel CPU. But you need to have knowledge about hardware and software. You need a lot of time and patience, and you need to love this stuff. And the software part is the worst one, a lot of troubleshooting to have something working. At the same time there are tons of tutorials both written or video. \n\n\nSo it depends on, you want a plug and play solution and have the money? You want more flexibility and need something budget? \n\nThe average 4 bay Synology with a basic dual core Intel Celeron is 700/800€. \nA used prebuilt with 4 bays, a G5400 and 8GB of ram is 130€. \nIf you want to go new, with a N100 or exaggerating with an i3 12100, you can go around 400/500€.",

It would advise you on everything, from the best setup for your disks, to the app available and how they work. And you don't need any extra to have those apps working. Same for your phone backup.\n\nWith a DIY approach, having your phone backup would mean, for me, writing you like 5 pages of stuff on how to setup it. Maybe not that much, but it's not straight forward, based on how you want it.\n\nIf you have knowledge on PC, maybe on gaming PC, is probably enough to setup a DIY system. It's mostly a matter of watching a lot of tutorial for each stuff you want to run.\n\nMaybe you can start watching some YouTube video, to understand the task and see if it's up to you. For example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjDoQA4C22c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjDoQA4C22c)\n\nFinding the right hardware to DIY is easy, this sub has a ton of the same answer at the same questions, but generally the approach is used with 8th gen intel stuff or new with N100 based board. Then as software Truenas is one of the most used, you can try searching for this on YouTube and see how it works, and understand if it's up to you. unRaid is a better and easier alternative, but behind paywall, and frankly, now i'm not up to recommend it.\n\nAh, i'm Italian too.

        "body": "The “[Fractal Design Define 7 XL](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08146GB6Y/)” (NOT a sponsored link) case is $225ish, holds 18 hard drives and 5 SSD drives. Add a mainboard with at least 2 NVME slots or 2 SATA dom ports to run your boot OS drives mirrored. This is most likely the best PC / Tower case today. \n\nHonestly though.. at that point it’s better to start looking at racks and chassis’s that house 24, 36, etc hard drives. The BEST choices here are the old Supermicro 24 and 36 bay chassis. Bought my 24-bay Supermicro CSE-846E16-R1200B chassis with dual 1200W PSUs 11 years ago, it was 4-6 years old then and I’ll be using it 10+ years from now. Pair it with an old UPS like a APC Smart-UPS SUA2200RM2U from eBay and add new generic batteries every 5 years or so for $100ish. I plug each PSU into its own SUA2200RM2U and each of those is now also plugged into a separately installed power circuit. Been using a Tripp Lite 25U 4-post deep rack in wheels for these 11 years with a Tripp Lite wall mount enclosure 9-12U.. can’t remember anymore, which held my 1U Supermicro chassis and mainboard pfsense firewall, a Netgear XS708E 8Port 10GbE switch and the termination ports for the 30+ drops I ran throughout the house back then.\n\nRead into redundancy.. backups are always needed but you should focus on redundancy from PSUs, fans, boot drives, data drives, UPSs, power circuits, cold spares on hand, etc. Retired now but one thing dealing with servers and data centers since the late 80s and my own home basement server room today is that I’d rather depend on redundancy over the successful restoration of a backup.. and I’ve spent years managing those as well. Redundancy trumps backups in nearly every aspect but is rarely talked about as it can add to the costs but it’s soo worth having. \n\nRack systems don’t have to be loud or power hungry either. Look at used enterprise hardware like the Supermicro chassises, APC SmartUPS, etc. The stuff just typically lasts much longer. We’re still running a SmartUPS from 24 years ago and simply replace the batteries as needed from Amazon. Rack and enterprise hardware are dsigned to run in data centers with 24/7/365 use to millions of users. For home use fans can be dialed down to run on low. I leave the Supermicro and Dell server fans installed but in low. Switches and small 1U chassises I’ll usually swap the fans out with a quieter Noctua fan.\n\nInvest some money as this could be a long term build so look into Supermicro boards, just use ECC ram, if 10GbE isn’t on the mainboard then ensure it can be added via a card and go with a multiport card. \n\nBuild this as a dedicated standalone NAS. Even if you plan to run TrueNAS Scale for example.. just use it as a NAS and forget all the virtual crap on this system. I prefer to stick to a single manufacturer and brand drive.. WD Red NAS drives have been absolutely perfect for me starting with 6 then 24x 4TB drives, replaced those 5ish years later with 8TB drives and currently filled with 12TB drives. I’ve had maybe 6 of all these drives error, none have failed, over this time and most of those older 8TB and 4TB drives are still running in other systems today. These are the slower 5400rpm drives which running cooler, cheaper and likely longer than the faster drives. More then fast enough for normal data and streaming. \n\nBuild yourself a virtualization server for all your services and simply access the NAS data via shares. A fantasticly priced rack option for this is the Dell R730XD that come loaded with options in the $600 range.. again, through eBay. \n\n\nMy current dedicated NAS I put together 11 years ago… I’m looking to build a second NAS next year and will be likely be looking at another 24 bay Supermicro at add above this one and below the 4 Dell virtual servers. \n\nMy FreeNAS/TrueNAS Scale Build\n\nChassis: Supermicro CSE-846E16-R1200B 1200W PSUs\n\nMainboard: Supermicro MBD-X10SRL-F\n\nCPU: Intel Xeon E5-1650 v3 Haswell-EP 3.5GHz\n\nCooler: Noctua NH-U9DX i4 Cooler\n\nRam: 64GB Samsung SDRAM ECC Reg DDR4 M393A2G40DB0-CPB\n\nDrives: 24x 12TB WD Reds x 4 RAIDz2\n\nBoot: 2 Mirrored Supermicro SSD-DM064-PHI SATA DOM\n\nController: IBM ServeRAID M1015\n\nNIC: 2 x Intel 10GbE X540-T1 bonded NICs",

Virtual Serial Port access to the UEFI was also messed up in early firmware.\n\nAs for I P, keep in mind since Gen9 still used iLO 4, some of the issues with the iLO 4 NAND going corrupt can take the I P down with it.         \nYou can download the Intelligent Provisioning 2.x Recovery Media (ISO) from HPE and boot from that via iLO and effectively try to re-image the I P partition.        \nBut if the iLO NAND is hosed, this may not work, and the backup plan of using the one built into the SPP is your fall back plan.           \nWhen you hit F9 and select Smart Storage Admin from there, it basically tries to boot into Intelligent Provisioning and passes a boot param to go straight to the SSA GUI and bypass the normal menus.

There will be a 1TB boot drive SSD (contemplating a mirror for that).\n\nI will likely be running a mix of containers and VMs for the AI workloads, the web projects, and the backup endpoint (Haven't decided on what, but leaning towards syncthing).  I haven't explored what kind of LXCs are available, but all my current web infrastructure is run in docker containers, so may just set up a VM as a docker host or migrate to run in LXCs.\n\nThis server will likely eventually end up colo'd in a datacenter, I'll use tailscale and cloudflare tunnels for access. I definitely try to minimize attack surfaces.\n\nI guess the big questions I have are 1: does this all make sense? 2: is there any benefit to running TrueNAS Scale?  I don't think I can run it bare metal since it doesn't support GPU passthrough.  Any benefit to running it as a VM in proxmox since Proxmox supports ZFS natively?\n\nI've never used Proxmox before but I'm familiar with VMWare and Docker so I want to make sure I'm going down a good path.

Load all the stuff in it you want to run, if you find yourself running into reaource limitations then buy two more and configure them as a cluster. You you start off with docker then you can scale up using swarm and have containers load managed across the nodes, some services can benefit from multiple instances so im swarm you can configure them to make the best use of your resources.\n\nClustering also gives the added advantage of being able to migrate services off of a node in order to apply updates etc without losing access to those services or crashing your network if you are running things like pihole.\n\nThe systems I'm talking about can usually be had for under $200 each with 8-16GB memory and usually a small M.2... ram is cheap and most of the systems support up to 64GB so you could probably max out a node for under $300 each.

    "selftext": "Im building homelab. I wanted to enable AMT on HP Elitedesk 800 G5 SFF for remote management. Currently Proxmox installed. I have two of them so some remote management would be useful.\n\nI enabled it in BIOS, then set the password, enabled all settings in ME window.\n\nAfter long hours of messsing arround with amttool, TigerVNC i found that TLS is not working at all and default port for webui is 16992 (not 16993). I was happy for a moment but then i found that there is not much useful features there - only info and some power options. No other things like iPMI/iLO/iRMC/iDRAC has - remote screen, storage etc.\n\nFinally managed to connect to it with MeshCommander in docker. BUT! Remote connection works but requires the code from the screen which defies the whole idea of remote (monitorless) management. SOL worked once up to the uefi menu, later it stopped. I learned that i have to enable serial port in grub. So i did it but now it does not work at all. The icon blinks on HP's screen (proxmox text console) indicating that there is a connection from MeshCommander but nothing is shown in MC web console window. And for the life of me i can't even make it work as before - in uefi menu.\n\nThis whole experience is so frustrating. I'll probably just end up spending money on 3 or 4 JetKVMs. I'll cost me more and will have to wait a month or more but at least it will be reliable solution.\n\nConclusion: don't be me and try to AMT work. Just look for something else.\n\nEDIT: I managed to disable the code verification but Remote Desktop doesn't work when you disconnect the monitor ... What a load piece of \\*\\*\\*\n\nEDIT2: Ok it works. I mean with Remote Desktop, not with SOL. But i had to disable the code verification and plug in HDMI dummy through DP-HDMI adapter. Now i have access even for UEFI/boot menu which i cared about the most.",

I can personally vouch for Aoostar, had R1 and am very satisfied with it, currently waiting for WTR Pro to arive.\n\nDIY market is story for itself. :)",

No - QNAP's been around for almost as long. I've got a 6 bay TS-639 Pro from 2009 that's still running. It's probably got roughly 14,000 hours of on time; and it's been solid. I started with 3x1TB in RAID5, moved to 6x3TB in RAID6 (paltry by today's data hoarders) and have swapped the PSU once (a few years back) and it's still running today.\n\nI've also got a 4 bay USB 3 enclosure of those (I need to rescue data from a 4 bay MacOS setup in a time crunch so I bought it, solved that problem, not it's a JBOD hanging off a RPI5 :)).\n\nEDIT: Oh and for anyone who asks \"why not DIY?\" - it's all timing. My QNAP is 16 years old. I'd just moved into a tiny apartment and the noise of my tower of home lab mid-towers was too much for my better half. She nicely asked me to make it silent. Since the QNAP is the size of a toaster, it sat in our office, atop a dresser - and barely made a sound. Gave us closet space back and a happier existence. Now of course there a lots of ways to do silent PC's, very small cases, even NAS DIY ones - but that wasn't the case (Ha) as much back then.",

But for a 4 bay you need to have a desktop computer which some people don't have access to since they most use laptops. \n  - or you can buy a DAS to pair with your hardware since that is cheaper. But I'm not sure if there are good DAS on the market \n- You can go to PC part picker website to calculate how much it will cost to build your own machine with a budget of $500\n- You can also look at your second hand market and see if you can get used parts. \n  - depending on what you are running, it may not need a lot of processing power\n\nWhile DYI is more expensive upfront. It's typically cheaper in the long run because you can replace individual parts VS buying a whole new machine. But maybe UGreen has some customizable options\n\nSoftware \n\nYou can always buy the UGreen NAS if you feel it is the cheapest option for you for hardware and if you require better software you can put a different OS on the hardware.\n\nI believe UGreen will still provide support even if there a different OS on it. [Reference video on putting different OS on UGreen NAS](https://youtu.be/gO2k3kZlq50?si=XgAtVIlfVwXh5Ccn)\n\nHope that helps",

    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI'm struggling finding a motherboard/CPU duo that fit my needs for a new Docker server. I already did some research but it is not easy to find ALL the infos about PCIe port speed on hardware search websites.\n\nThese are my requirements (almost non negotiable if I may say so!😇) :\n\n* Preferably Intel, so I can \"reuse\" that server in the future and mix it in a virtualization cluster with other PCs I already own.\n* This Intel should have Quick Sync. This is for now the most efficient/fastest way I found for my multimedia server transcoding (Emby + Plex)\n* I want to have at least 3 PCIe ports, 4 would be a plus. I need at least 1xgen5 16x and 1xgen4 16x. The gen5 if for a future GPU (within 1 year max) and the gen4 is for a NVIDIA L4 I already own. I want to be able to use both for a while and distribute the containers on one or the other. The 3rd port is for a dual 10Gb/s NIC. The 4th  would be a plus for any extension/test, like remote control, etc...\n* This CPU/MB needs to be able to address 256 GB of RAM. I will also run several VMs on that host and some will be pretty big.\n\nFor now, I saw that the newest Intel i9 CPUs that would fit newest MBs (mainly Z890 chipset) can only address 192GB of RAM, only older CPUs can go above, but then the amount of ports with high speed doesn't match my needs. Also a lot of MBs will downgrade their PCIe speed if 2 GPUs are connected.\n\nTherefore comes my struggle... I could not find yet any MB/CPU that would allow \"so much\" requirements yet. Maybe the amount of PCI lane is an hard limitation on normal Intels and I need to go to Xeon family, but there is very few information on website that host hardware databases about them (and there if any, there is way less Xeons with Quick Sync. Of course Xeon is also not cheap!\n\nThis is where I need some help, maybe one of you already had such dual GPU requirements and can share the info.\n\nThanks in advance for your propositions! 😉\n\nPS: the size of MB doesn't matter, this will go in a big Sliger CX4713 case, so almost any size is an option...",

        "body": "If you want 32+ PCIe Lanes and over around 128GB of RAM you're looking for an HEDT/Server Plattform. Desktop Plattforms top out around 20-24 Lanes, maybe 28 if you count the connection between CPU and Chipset and only have dual channel, so 4 DIMM slots max.\n\nSo Xeon-W, AMD Threadripper, Xeon Scalable or AMD EPYC. Those don't have iGPUs and are usually pretty high power, but they often have IPMI (Remote Management) and can address a lot of RAM (easily 128GB - 1TB), so that's a plus. They are usually available in ATX or E-ATX form factors and you can find older generations for relatively cheap. 1st gen EPYC is currently some of the the best price per PCIe lane with 70-80 PCIe 3.0 Lanes for like 400$ for CPU+Mainboard (Supermicro H11SSL-i and Gigabyte MZ01-CE). And at that price you can buy an Arc A310/A380 for like 100$ to do QuickSync since you now have more than enough PCIe Lanes.\n\nFor anything newer (PCIe 4.0) though you'll probably be spending at least 1000$ and current Gen (PCIe 5.0) is even more expensive. Those get into Intel Sapphire/Emerald Rapids Territory, EPYC Genoa or Turin on the AMD Side.",

    "selftext": "I am upgrading a 2020 27 iMac and am considering an M4 mini and a M2 Max Studio base because I have a docking station already setup for work with monitors etc.  Both are happily in the budget.  The current base M4 studio is a little outside of budget if I also want to upgrade stuff in the rack.   I use a mix of server gear at home, we have 5 adults all partially or fully working remote, use a UnFi UDM Pro with 2 APs for firewall etc,  and have a server rack with a CISCO C240 M4, Dell 730, Cisco switches and separately an HP ML350 G9 for learning and \"playing\".  The Mac gear is great for non work general purpose use in our household, 3 of the 5 of us have both Macs and windows units.  I am going to separately expand our homelab stuff, but the current M4 studio and the older M2 Mac Studio both seem to have a good use case for AI for use with after work boxes ( please.note that I can't use work equipment for personal use).  Does anyone here have experience with the mini M4, the Mac Studio M2 Max or the Mac Studio M4 max (all base units so roughly $600 up to $2000 between the three)?   All three are available new.  I get the comparisons for what I do, and even what I want to do, it's what I want to play in that I am confused on.  I have done some interesting spreadsheet work that I would like to continue and expand, some citizen scientists stuff I am looking at (air and water modeling), and am looking at adopting AI when I have been vehemently opposed up to now.  Late adopter I know.  That being said, right now I am limited to duck duck go and their link to chat GTP for the iMac, and Google Gemini for non-serious stuff (I have very limited exposure to AI if that isn't evident yet).  Would the increase in cost for the studio (either version) net me anything in your eyes other than ram, more gpu cores and 10 g port?  Really, will either Mac Studio help me play more in the AI realm?  Assuming apple completely drops the ball on AI, does your answer stay the same?  Ultimately, this is a \"I don't know what I don't know\" and  when I post in the r/Mac subreddit or any of the others, they aren't going to point out the multi OS and opportunities comparison that some of you probably can.  And I use cloud based storage reluctantly at best, so the concept of an AI model on a box at home that is sandboxed is something that I will be researching more.  \n\nthanks in advance for your advice on how I should spend money.

You could be looking into a mac and the mac could not be the best bet... maybe an ampere altra, maybe a computer with octane and Hailo-8, maybe the mac-mini with a Coral USB. \n\nhope this brings some light into the conversation",

All of the stuff in the rack and the other gear is to show there are a lot of opportunities for upgrades and frankly more want than budget.  As such, I plan on posting a similar question in a few of the Mac subreddits, but thought this group could also offer some insight on better ways to spend money since it has such a wide range of home users.  And since most of the folks I know in IT are now dealing with Windows, Linux and Apples' iOS I hoped this group would have some insight to share.\n\n\"Playing with\" encompasses the CISCO gear helping one of the five get certified, the HP helping me at work, my \"playing with\" includes a transition from a completely different field to IT and all that entails along with a few data intensive projects I want to do that are completely unrelated to work, as well as a learning environment for two of the group.  I am not articulating well, sorry for the confusion.  \n\nWith regards to AI, I am going from a \"non believer, never do mentality\" to something that I need to understand professionally .  Thus, although I understand the value of the upgrade for my current needs wrt the 2020 iMac to a mini or studio, I have no idea if they would be beneficial for a more AI focused workload and whether I should spend the money to go with the studio, or whether I should spend money elsewhere and just get the mini to replace the iMac\n\nhopefully that narrows it down a bit",

    "title": "How many HDDs can it handle?",
    "selftext": "I have a HP ProDesk 600 G6 that I use as a small homelab. Currently, It only has a 2TB HDD for storage and a 500GB SSD for various containers.\n\nSince I'd like to expand the storage, I've bought an LSI HBA with external ports and I'm planning on buying an enclosure for HDDs. It should handle 5 HDDs but I'm thinking about mixing in some SSDs so I might go with something like 3 HDDs and 3 SSDs\n\nI'm wondering how many HDDs/SSDs can the OEM PSU handle and do I need to buy an external PSU for those? The OEM PSU only has two power cables, so I'm thinking of to using one of those 1to5 connectors.\n\n In case I need to buy an external PSU, would HDD spinning down still work ? ",

If not then get yourself an HP Elitedesk 800 G4 Mini... you can pick one up for around $150 and it will give you comparable compute power to those Dell units at a fraction of the cost noise and heat. Those old AMD chips were crap compared to their Xeon counterparts of the time and an 8th Gen Intel chip (like what's in the HP I suggested) will walk all over the xeons. Long story short you will get comparable performance out of a system the size of a hardcover book rather than those beasts.\n\nIf you need LFF drives then the system I recommended also comes in a tower format, will use more power than the mini but will give you 2x PCIE x16 slots, 2x PCIE x1 slots, 2x M.2 slots, space for 2x3.5\" drives but can probably fit a 3rd if you ditch the optical drive. So plenty of room for expansion but generally a little bit more expensive than the Mini.",

        "body": "If I might offer my advice, I have been in broadcast for the past 10 years. It is my recommendation that you should highly consider purchasing an out of the box system like the Tricaster TC1($16K), this has 16 SDI inputs. But more importantly, it is built by a video equipment company.  I only say this last part, because we build home labs to experiment with and learn about real world systems (and to heat our homes in the winter months). You will want to have a system that you can learn marketable skills with.  The Tricaster is built like a proper production switcher and you can learn a lot on that system. Second, I would say unless you already have cameras, your budget might be, well how do I put this... Optimistic.  Broadcast quality cameras are expensive, a \"cheap\" Panasonic PTZ is about $5K. Consumer cameras have excessive latency on the outputs.\n\nIf you are dead set on building your own solution, I would caution you against, Blackmagic products. Blackmagic are price point optimized. I'm not saying I don't have any BMD at my station, but nothing mission critical for sure. And I keep a cold spare of every Black Magic product we have in use. I think, you should look at something better, ideally the AJA Kona or Corvid cards or at the minimum the Magwell capture cards.  I have a bunch of systems with the AJA Kona cards, reliable, stable, and very low latency. My VMIX rigs have the Magwell mini cards, very compact setups. And high density (4 SDI on an m.2)\n\nI'm going to go back a bit on my previous advice here, but for live production on a budget the Black Magic ATEM switch is a good choice. They have at most 1 frame latency. I would advise you to plan on replacing the switch on a regular basis even if it has not failed.  If you are doing a show and your switch fails you lose that client and the next ten.\n\nVideo can be deceptively simple yet become incredibly complex quickly. Video production systems are very much task optimized products. You will need to decide the purpose of your home lab first.  Streaming is easy, OBS, VMIX, and a number of other products work very well for this. Latency is not a significant concern. However if you need to have embedded captions, multi language audio, or multichannel audio things become difficult very quickly. PC software switched video also suffers from latency problems. For streaming this is not an issue, but for broadcast and live events it can be a deal breaker. That is why the cost for most stations air-chain, from camera to MUX is around $1M. Don't get me wrong, there are some absolutely amazing PC solutions. As I mentioned we have VMIX and NewTek systems. (BTW NewTek started in my home town, I had a prototype Video toaster in my Amiga). We are far closer to a PC workflow than ever before. But there are still serious gaps.  Even the Tricaster has significant frame latency, also can't work with CTA-708 captions. There is a workflow that sort of allows alternative languages via Tricaster. But it is a hack.  VMIX does not function at all like production video equipment, it is entirely its own animal. VMIX also cannot work with proper captions, multichannel, or multi language. However reporters seem to be able to run the very basic switching on VMIX. \n\nPS, burning captions into the video from an AI speech to text engine is not proper captioning. Yes you \"can\" use a transparent layer with caption text but should you?",

It is a 8 SDI card and only ½ height.\nRemember if you are trying to have a local output for public display, software latency will hurt you. Tim and his team have spent many years and millions getting the Tricaster down to around 2-3 frames of latency. They have even gone so far as to have matrox build custom firmware just for the TriCaster.  Even with the lowest latency of any PC based switcher, many live production clients still consider that as excessive for live displays.\n\nMy experience with black magic comes from a 24/7/365 broadcasting environment. I am not saying they are bad products, just cost optimized. So there's tradeoffs, the cards are \"slow\", multiple frame delay on input and outputs. You're looking at a best case of well over 5 frames of latency.and this is just pass through. The drivers are not exactly stable for long duration operations. Lots of jitter on the SDI outputs. Captioning is not properly passed etc. however best 8 input SDI card for under $1k. The Magwell mini is great for portable VMIX rigs that a reporter can grab and go. \nI have only had two Black Magic cards fail and need replacement, but anything using one needs rebooting regularly. I have had issues with sources that come from blackmagic cards. Frame sync, audio packet loss, jitter etc. A reboot always fixes it but I still get calls.\n\nAs for demoscener, I'm pretty simple these days, I keep a TV station running and take care of my family.

    "selftext": "I am trying to figure out the best way to use all of my hardware.\n\nRight now I have the following in my homelab:\n\nA Synology DS 918+ with 4 8TB Ironwolf Pro drives that I use primarily for storage/backups. \n\nAn Unraid box with a Ryzen 5800X, GTX 1660 Super, ASUS x570 motherboard, 64 GB of ECC RAM, Intel 10Gbe NIC. This server has 3x16TB Ironwolf Pro drives. I use this system primarily for media. It idles between 60 and 70 watts (according to the UPS) but when the drives spin up and it's doing things it operates around 100-120 watts. I have enabled ECO mode, disabled the components I don't use (onboard audio and NIC) and used powertop and the NVidia powerdown script.\n\nI would like to add home automation and security cameras into the mix. I'd also like to play around with VMs and learn Linux and do some general experimentation.\n\nI am trying to move my home to 2.5Gbe+ network. I have several computers running 2.5Gbe and one running 10 Gbe.\n\nI recently picked up a 13500 CPU for cheap and am thinking of building a system around that. With Quicksync and Intel \n\nI'd like to retire the Synology. My thought was to move Unraid to the 13500 (probably on a non-ECC system) and use the Ryzen systen for Truenas. I would move the 3x16TB drives to the 13500 and reformat the 4x8TB drives as ZFS (raidz1) in Truenas on the Ryzen box. But it seems silly to have multiple servers running for a starter setup. On the other hand, I like the flexibility of Unraid for adding drives, but am not 100% confident in its implementation of ZFS to have it handle both duties. I do have a HBA if needed.\n\nI like the reduced power draw of the Intel chip, but not sure if would be worth getting an ECC motherboard and new DIMMs just to take advantage of that. Power is about $0.175/kWh where I live.\n\nWhat do people recommend? I don't mind selling off some gear and, if necessary, buying something that will make more sense in the long run. I'd like to get a reliable, capable system I can grow.",

Any advice is appreciated, but I'm looking specifically for a video/podcast series that goes very in-depth into everything I need to know to be fluent with linux, especially the command prompt, as well as all the necessary softwares and programs required to take on something like this.\n\nSo thanks everyone, and please be patient with me!

Network appliances have processor requirements that depend on what, if any, next-generation services the appliance is to run. Ditto media servers; if you don't need transcoding, it's one set of requirements; if you do, it's a very different one...\n\nLet me give you the range. On the low end, I am running a standalone AdGuard Home installation on a BeeLink tiny PC with an Atom x5-Z8350 under Alpine Linux. On the high end, earlier this year, I have built a network appliance for a friend who requested 2.5 Gbps VPN capability, so that one was built on a Lenovo M720q platform with an i7-8700T processor. Neither is, strictly speaking, the limit. You can go down to dual-core Atoms on the low end and up to i9 on the high end...",

I want to replicate only the users and backups datasets (no need to replicate mediahub).\n\nI’m looking for a simple and reliable solution for this kind of replication and backup.\n\n🤔 My questions:\n• Is the way I did the \"NAS\" recommended, or is there a better strategy? \n\n• What is the simplest and most reliable method to replicate these ZFS datasets? \n\n• I heard about sanoid, a good tool? Should I install it on an LXC like Samba or directly on the Host?\n\nAny examples of backup strategies, or lessons learned would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

What is illegal, according to Russian law, is: “Scientific, scientific-technical and statistical information on the methods and techniques of providing access to information resources and/or information and telecommunication networks, access to which is restricted on the territory of Russia.” I am not asking for ways to bypass those restrictions, I’m asking how to connect to my own services securely. Most of them are published on the Internet under a .ru domain registered in my name, but I need access not only to web services but also to ssh(and other management stuff), and I don’t want to expose it to the public Internet. You also said that “there is no such thing as real end-to-end encryption in Russia.” That isn’t true. isps can see packet metadata and encrypted payload, but they cannot decrypt https traffic (this holds in any country). In fact, that inability to break https is one of the main reasons the entire youtube site is banned here rather than just specific videos. Our national root CA isn’t enforced, so they can’t perform a mitm attack with it.",

Ultimately, I decided fans are a bit louder than what I'd like (this is in my living room) and moved my setup to a custom built Fractal Node304.\n\nSide note: \"Just backup your config and upload back to new TrueNAS setup\" does not friggin work. In my case it completely bricked the VM. Thankfully, I had backup of clean install. After several bricks, I decieded to setup manually. Importing ZFS pools works perfectly fine and it retains permissions etc so I got most of my config brought in this way.\n\nNode 304 certainly has some gimmicks and an unusual drive mount, but ultimately I'm quite happy with it. Temperatures are sitting at a comfortable 45-50 C and it is super quiet (partly because I went with a completely overkill cooler). I also put away the Lenovo Thinkcentre PCs for now. I'm learned as much as I'm willing to regarding Proxmox clusters and a single machine does all I need in my homelab with plenty of overhead left.\n\n**Entire system pulls about 100W, about 55W of this is consumed by the server.**\n\nWhat's in the picture:\n\n* Unifi Dream Machine\n* Cable Modem\n* CyberPower ST625U PSU\n* Sabrent Dual bay HDD dock for local backups\n* SLZB-06 for Zigbee control over network\n* Atom Lite Bluetooth proxy\n* IKEA Skadis for organization (hooks, shelves, bungees etc.)\n* Fractal Node 304 Case\n   * Erying Motherboard with integrated i5-11500H (yes, it's a mobile CPU, from AliExpress)\n   * 32 GB DDR4 RAM\n   * 550W be quiet!

    "selftext": "After my trusty laptop home server, which ran 24/7 for over a year, finally succumbed to hardware failure (corrupted drives), I'm planning to build my first dedicated, \"serious\" home lab.

I live in Greece, so parts availability can be a bit tricky, and I'm aiming to keep the initial cost under €1000. Here is the build I've put together after some research:\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n* **Virtualization:** Proxmox will be the hypervisor.\n* **Networking:** OPNsense will be virtualized to act as my main router/firewall.\n* **Services:** The server will run Home Assistant, various Docker containers (Paperless-ngx, Mealie, Vikunja), a media server stack (Jellyfin & the Arrs), and Immich for photos.\n\nThese service for now.

Your onboard is 2.5 gigabit so it may be worth getting a matching NIC if you plan on hosting a firewall \n\nDo you need a mobo with wifi and Bluetooth? You maybe able to get a motherboard for cheaper. But maybe it doesn't come in your form factor?\n\nIf you are on a budget, you can try your second hand market (I know you mentioned it's hard to find parts). \n\nHope that helps",

    "title": "Thermals stress testing?",
    "selftext": "Hey!! I got into this hobby years ago and recently got a mini rack to put all the gadgets I accumulated together. I’m very open to suggestions about my specific question and anything else about my rack :) \n\nQuestion: How are y’all stress testing for thermals? Specifically for a UniFi Express router and Proxmox?\n\nI have a 4u mini rack that I crammed a lot of stuff into 😅 I’m thinking about adding in a 2U blank in the front to hold a tablet for a Grafana dashboard but I’m nervous about thermals.\n\nI hacked together a raspberry pi zero with single bus thermal sensors to monitor rack air temps and I’m tracking CPU temps. \n\nIt’s running a bit warmer at idle than usual with the tablet on but nothing crazy over the last day. I’m worried about spikes from the UniFi express router and the 2 mini PC’s. The RPi’s be chillin 😎 \n\nThe whole rack runs off one outlet and idles at ~35-40w, I’m guessing that’s why idle temps are fine but I’m worried about peaks, it could get up to ~100-120w. \n\nIdeally, the test would run from web GUI and be easy to manually turn off quickly in case it opens a portal to the underworld. I’m thinking a 1 hour peak load test, I can’t imagine a world where I’d be sitting at peak load for more than a few minutes. \n\nMy current thought is to put the 2 mini PC’s on separate VLANs and run some sort of file transfer task between them so the traffic is forced to go through the router, and add another task on the mini PC’s to use up the rest of the CPU. The specifics is where I need some advice. \n\nIf I need to, I’ll move things out of the rack or expand to 8u so it doesn’t burst into flames, but if I can find a way to make this work safely I’d much rather have this nice compact unit with the screen in front! \n\nOpen to suggestions on this test and on anything else :) \n\nHardware:\n-2 miniPC’s running proxmox, one’s a web server and the other hosts management/monitoring containers like prometheus, ansible, loki, and a VM for OpenWRT to create a DMZ and reverse proxy for the web server\n\n-2 raspberry pi 4B’s, one for home assistant the other is for docker containers (just piaware at the moment) + NUT + VPN tunnel for remote access to LAN \n\n-UniFi express router (I use my travel router as an access point to boost my wifi signal when I’m home) \n\n-Hue bridge (haven’t had range issues luckily) \n\n-2 fanless switches, one managed 8x1Gb and one unmanaged 4x2.5Gb/2x10Gb  \n\nCooling:\n2 40mm noctua fans on the back for exhaust\n1 120mm arctic slim fan on the bottom for intake",

NOTE: I could not get my Mac Studio M2 to work with the standard MTU 9000, it maxed out at 8192. Your system may differ.\n\n2. I strongly suggest Macs use Ethernet over Thunderbolt. Put a Thunderbolt 4 card in your TrueNAS machine and you get 40GbE to the Mac. The maximum length of standard copper Thunderbolt 4 cables is 3 meters, $159, cheap. AFAIK nobody but Apple makes them at this length, they stick to 2m. Anything longer, you're going to need Thunderbolt fiber optic cables at insanely high prices.\n\n3. SMB sucks on Macs. It is hard to tune for max performance. I tried NFS which is said to run better, but I am still trying to get it to work.",

Where the \"next free space\"  will be on each disk is not known until the write occurs.  each write requires a lookup (seek) + write operation which happens once every 1/7200'th of a minute (for a 7200RPM drive)  or once every 8.3ms. \n\nEach \"redundancy\" disk _also_ needs to be written to once per write to another disk;  so these have no impact on the overall write throughput. \n\nSee posts like https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/x2puge/synchronous_write_question/ or https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/mzit3i/async_vs_synch_writes_zfs/ ultimately:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O  for a better understanding of what's actually going on. \n\nIf you're serving the volume on the network using CIFS => By default all writes are synchronous.

Everything else get's queued up and performed later.    In high-throughput situations,  this means that stream optimization can occur.    If the disk get's ONE BLOCK and flushes it;   the write is functionally \"random\".    If the disk get's a stream of blocks;  the spot can be seeked once and a stream of blocks written sequentially. \n\nIMO;  grab a UPS for the NAS,  and disable sync.

The idea isn't that it's accepting a large pool of waiting data, it's taking enough so it can do a larger single write commit on your disks, which is more efficient. Windows file sharing has a small packet size, which when sent to your NAS syncronous will tell it to write to disk immediately. So father than doing 256x1MB write actions, it is doing something like 1x64MB write. It also increases the synchronous write of a large number of small files because they're written as a large chunk via cache and creates less potential fragmentation as well.\n\nIf you have 5 disks, a 64GB cache SSD is plenty, though it will get way above average wear and tear so a WD blue will cry if you use it for that and not last too long that way.",

I got access to both a 640 and a 740 a few months back, and as they have NVMe's I was so ready for an upgrade to get blazing speeds for my containers and VMs. Good machines spec wise in terms of ram and cpu, but powering them up I realized this is a NO go in a tiny office. So loud and no real option to control the fans, so I guess I'm stuck with my 13th gen for now. If you find a 14th gen with really outdated BIOS and iDRAC fw you might be able to control the fan speed, but mine were updated with no option to downgrade to the version supporting fan control. I haven't used a tower version of any 14th gen Dell, but they might be acceptable noise vise due to the larger fan size.\n\nThe use case you have does not seem to indicate you need tons of power, so  you could probably get away with a low/mid end PC (Ryzen 5-series or Intel 11th gen, or newer) and add both the Quadra, the Mellanox and all your drives in one SILENT box with decent fans. You do lose the iDRAC and dual PSU, but I guess a PiKVM or similar can mitigate the lack of iDRAC. I've only had one PSU break for me in the last 20 years, so no big concern for me if you get a decent one. A used workstation would probably also fit the bill. Both Lenovo and Dell have models that's not too expensive these days.\n\nThat being said - if my \"fuck you account\" was filled to the brim with cash I would get 3 mini pc's with Ryzen 8845HS and 128gb DDR5 in order to run a Proxmox cluster with Ceph, but that would easily amount to $5K or more, so it's sadly a no-go.",

I wanted to keep all on my 3d printed rack so i decided to get 4 1Tb laptop HDD, in an aliexpress olomaster 5.25\" to 4x 2.5\" jbod. I wantdd to virtualize a TrueNas instance on the dell optiplex 3050 mff that runs Proxmox 8.3 . As that dell 3050 mff only has one sata port, i needed more to connect the hard drives. I bought off Aliexpress a JMB585 based nvme to 5x sata converter. Howerver, i can't seem to make the disks being recognized into proxmox.\n\nHere is what i have tried :\n- rebooting the server (hey, at least i tried...)\n- as disks are not recognized in bios, i tried verifying the disks and the adapter works : booting into ubuntu 24.04 live show all the disks. I can interact with them so the adapter and the disks works. It's not an harware issue.\n- switching from raid mode to ahci in the Bios.\n-enable legacy boot in bios.\n\nDoes anyone has any ideas on what can i do to make it work or has a work around for this issue ? I am fairly new to proxmox so i don't have a lot of knowledge when I face an issue like that. Thank's in advance !",

They dont react to fancurves, spinning up..spinning down in a rythm of seconds. \n\n\n\nIs it possible that the (consumber grade) motherboards Fan-ports dont support the nessecery voltage for these beasts or do they need some specielized Supermicro Fancontrol?\n\nWhen powering them with a seprate device like this: [https://www.ebay.de/itm/273163924510?var=572430379894](https://www.ebay.de/itm/273163924510?var=572430379894)\n\nthey work perfectly..at FULL Power.

But I can tell you these fans are compatible with regular fan controllers and connectors. They’re so powerful though, so make sure the current ratings of any add-ons are safe if you plan on ever running them full blast.  \n\nI wired mine up to a similar splitter as your photo and control that with an Arduino that generates a PWM signal based on temperature. I have a stock 4U SM server I did this in but it’s so jam packed with shit it’s hard finding space for just a little Arduino. But if you replaced your server’s guts with new parts then I imagine you’ll have more room to work with.  \n\nOh and since these fans can draw so much current I power them with the 12V from an IDE cable like in your photo. As long as you connect a 4-pin PWM fan wire to that middle port on the splitter you should get good results.",

The riser 3 x16 PCIe slot has a power adapter to handle a second GPU. However, unlike the non-XD R730, the rear flex bay hard drive housings are in the way and fixed to the chassis. I've seen others successfully configure a dual P100 setup on the non-XD R730, so, other than physical obstructions, I don't see why this wouldn't be possible on the R730XD.   \nI don't use these rear flex bay slots (and I don't know what the point is aside from simply having two more drives; the chassis can hold up to 24 drives in the front bays). So I don't plan to use them in the future, and I am considering drilling out the fasteners to make room for a second P100, which will double my VRAM capacity.   \nHas anyone ever done this, and if so, how did it work out? Do you have any tips for removing these physical slots, or should I consider an alternative approach? This is just a hobby homelab, and I don't run anything critical or production on it.  \n  \nThanks for the feedback!  \n",

Took it inside, despite the surface damage it appears to work perfectly fine. \n\nOnly question is: What do I do with it? Obviously very loud, so that's fun, but is there any value to it? I run a Plex server on a different computer, and am super interested in some kind of NAS setup, but for now I have no plan. \n\nIs it worth it to use this for something, or is it just going to be a pain in my ass? Thanks in advance. ",

    "selftext": "Hi all.\n\nHow do I go about correctly accessing / exposing my small homelab through tailscale to my devices?? I'v been following documentation but I'm having a rough weekend and cant seem to get it all to work perfectly.\n\nThe Truenas instance is being used as the endpoint.\n\nHow do I point Tailscale to use my pi hole for every user to get the adblock going without absolutely tanking throughput. I also want to eventually get things like a minecraft server running for siblings but that will run as an applet under Truenas which should be just a case of using the existing IP to Truenas\n\nI cant seem to figure out how I need to be writing out the address to the Truenas instance for file sharing. I can access the admin console with the IP that Tailscale has given me which shows its at least working. How do I go about writing out the correct address to get it to actually register the fileserver? Locally its fine. But for the external connection I don't really know how to point it out.\n\nThanks commenters, I had been awake for abt 36hrs at that point and all the cogs were smoking and grinding and things were not exactly making much sense at all. Alls good and working now",

If you turn your TrueNAS into a subnet router then anything on the tailnet can access any of the services on your local network, including a future minecraft server.\n\nYou can't just point your TrueNAS instance at the pihole.",

    "selftext": "Hi Guys!\n\nI’ve been self-hosting using **Cockpit with cockpit-machines (libvirt + KVM)**, and while it’s a nice interface, I’m noticing that the virtual machines are significantly **slower than expected**, even when assigned generous RAM and CPU.\n\n* **Model:** Lenovo ThinkSystem (Tower)\n* **CPU:** 4 physical cores (no hyper-threading)\n* **RAM:** 16GB DDR4\n* **Storage:** SATA HDD (basic drive, not SSD)\n* **Virtualization Stack:** Cockpit + cockpit-machines + libvirt/KVM on Ubuntu\n\nEven with a VM assigned, say, 14GB RAM and 3 cores, **the performance is sluggish.** simple tasks feel delayed, and system responsiveness is poor. The host system itself is mostly idle, so I’m not saturating the CPU or disk (as far as `htop` and `iotop` suggest), but things inside the VM are just slow.\n\nI’m considering upgrading the **RAM to 32GB**, but before I spend on it, I want to **confirm if RAM is actually the bottleneck here**. Could this be due to something else, like Cockpit overhead, KVM configuration, or the fact that I'm running off a spinning disk?\n\n1. Is **16GB RAM a real limitation** for multiple or even a single decently-spec’d VM?\n2. Does anyone have similar experience with Cockpit VMs being slower than Proxmox or bare libvirt?\n3. Would switching to SSD or another virtualization stack help more than adding RAM?\n\nAny help or insight would be awesome. I don’t mind spending on upgrades, just want to make sure I’m fixing the right bottleneck.\n\nThanks!",

I’m trying to use ubuntu desktop on this server for the time being but I’m running into some very strange problems, the only thing I am able to run on this server is a live version of Ubuntu via the install USB. I tried downloading Ubuntu on an SSD but kept getting errors so then I downloaded Ubuntu onto another USB (not another installer version the actual full install) and I’m  unable to boot up the machine it gives no display out and the only sign of life from it is 2 beeps after 5 minutes and the fans ramping down. I want to go into the iLO web interface to look for errors to figure out what’s wrong but this unit was bought second hand and had a different password and/or user name than the default so I can’t login. I know you can reset it in the bios but another part of this problem is I’m unable to get into the bios lol, every time I had successfully booted the machine before via VGA for my display the machine would show no output until reaching the os booting. I would really like to be able to use the iLO of this machine and be able to boot via that USB of Ubuntu I made so any help with this would be appreciated.",

During this time you should USUALLY see the POST screen, it will be a somewhat graphical interface if you don't touch anything, but if you whack ESC (from memory) at the right time, it gets rid of the fancy graphical and gives you the console look and feel, which allows you to interract with it a bit more.\n\nIf the machine is truely locked down so you can't see POST and you don't know what the iLO details are though, you should go back to the person you purchased it from and query the details, it's pretty bad form for them to sell something that's locked down.",

I plugged it in to the wall with no load and the charge state read out around 90% out of the box; fans running at moderate level.  Fine.  Just get to 100% and they will turn off.  Wrong.  \n\nI hooked up my rack devices to it and left it going for 2-3 days, never getting over 15% load and still, moderate fan noise.  I disconnected it and for 2 months I just let it sit there, off, coming to terms with the realization I'd end up selling for a good discount to the next buyer.\n\nI finally got the time to file a ticket and go through the support process.  They suggested measuring the voltage across the main leads, but I didn't have a voltmeter.  \n\nI decided to give it one last college try, so I plugged it in unloaded for 4-5 days and the fans were OFF one morning.  YES.\n\nI put it back into the rack and hooked everything up to it.  The fans were back with their moderate noise.  F it.  I work for 3-4 more days with this thing whirring next to me.\n\nAs I'm on a work call into day 4ish I hear a BEEEEP and then the fans turned back off, unit showing fully online AC power conditioning.  And since then the fans have stayed off. \n\nAll that to say, the 5PX1500RTNG2 actually WILL get quiet if you give it a ton of time.  The battery state can say 100% and it could still need many more hours to get to a state for the fans to chill out.  \n\nI am finally happy with my decision to buy it, and recommend it for racks next to your desk/in your office space.

I was doing the comparison, and the 14600k/13600k stomps the 12900k and appears to have better CPU scores than the newest i5s.\n\nI know they got some issues, but they did extend the warranty.  I can't be crazy thinking this is a better deal, can I?\n\nIts 70% faster than the 10900k that sells for close to $500.\n\nI have slapped together a whole system for around $350 using a leftover power supply and nvme and its putting up numbers that shouldn't be possible for the price.\n\n[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yn9GzP](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yn9GzP)\n\nI'm guessing the AMD chips got so good that they started throwing e-cores and max power at so they could edge out the competition.\n\nI'm doing mostly video encoding and that's processor heavy, so the more umph the better.  I may have several i7-6700 optiplexes for sale soon.  lol",

The core premise though is that you want one of the following\n\na) a public endpoint that the remote service can monitor\n\nb) a cron job that runs every X minutes, verifying the local monitoring service is functional, and sending an \"everything is good on our end\" payload to a remote webhook\n\n\nIn both cases, you setup the remote service to notify you when it stops being able to verify that your local service is running.",

My budget is around $250-$300 / Rs 25000 - 30000. I have a lot of knowledge about pc's but this is the first time building one so help me out :), Thanks in advance\n\nMy List: [https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/3IEV8RJH9JB6P?ref\\_=wl\\_share](https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/3IEV8RJH9JB6P?ref_=wl_share)\n\nPS i tried looking for used/refurbised tower servers/NAS but couldn't find anything that suits me or is in my budget so if you'll have any contact or have any hardware for sale let me know about that to.(Im from India",

Unless your running a titanium PSU, that is sized for 2x the drives spun up and no more, then your PSU is probably the biggest single source of power use at idle ... and it gets worse with more drives. \n\n\\> [https://www.anandtech.com/show/2624/debunking-power-supply-myths/3](https://www.anandtech.com/show/2624/debunking-power-supply-myths/3)\n\n\\> [https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/80-plus-why-you-need-titanium-power-supplies-in-your-data-center](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/80-plus-why-you-need-titanium-power-supplies-in-your-data-center)\n\nIf your PSU is good enough, and you have a good smart plug then you should be able to tell if any of the drives are spinning. If your PSU is sized wrong, or crappy, or old then you're going to have problems. Even  if it isnt efficient, at idle, you likely have OTHER things that draw more power than it (tv's are big offenders for greedy stand by power use).",

    "selftext": "So I've got a stack of six HP and Dell minis and SFFs. I kind of went overboard buying/trading for increasingly powerful ones when I first jumped into all this. As a result, I've got a couple spares and am currently hosting a plain proxmox install on a G3 7500T for him, of course reverse proxied on one of my subdomains and home static (love my small Dutch municipal ISP btw, a single call and a couple questions and they did the static and put their router into pure bridge mode overnight and don't seem to care at all what I do) ... I guess what I'm considering doing is setting up a little network segment just for him. Anyway being new to this myself, but having a decent if rusty/outdated Linux background from say 20 years ago, and having a few other boxes on the shelf already running some public facing media and other services, and soon home automation stuff on careful VLANs... Is there anything that would be helpful for letting him have essentially full control of a couple machines to learn on, besides the obvious direct proxmox web UI root or ssh box, or any warnings other than making sure I trust him enough in the first place? If he ends up committing to the hobby I'm sure he'll get his own hardware back home eventually but I really don't mind having a couple things sitting here for him forever.\n\nI have a couple of other questions about things like network topology (currently shopping for an old but decent managed switch and planning to re-cable the three floors of the apartment) and project direction, but I'll save those for other posts when I've thought about what my intentions are a little more clearly in the first place.\n\nThanks. I'll toss in a couple rambling thoughts too, in case anyone has input.\n\nOne cool thing I think I will do with the lightest mini (also likely my jump box) is host a PXE server he can stash any ISOs and installers he wants on, and reboot his loaner machines to it (scripted installs or ipkvm since whatever I get won't be in use most of the time) and also use it as motivation to work on my own backups so he can utilize snapshots and so forth. I want to give him as much control and learning opportunity as possible other than the network itself. Once I'm done prototyping some other stuff for my own setup, I'll probably even have a third spare so he can truly do a cluster.",

    "selftext": "I'd like to ask for assistance regarding my current project plan.  \n  \nTo start off my homelab journey back then, I settled for a cheap 2nd hand M910Q that only came with a 128GB ssd. It was fine when I just started but now I'd like to expand my storage options to expand what I can experiment on (e.g. self hosted storage services)\n\nThe M910Q has 1 SATA and 1 M.2 NVME slot. The PCIE slot on my unit is unfortunately empty. Adding a drive to the m.2 slot is easy enough but I was curious if I could somehow add more SATA slots for cheaper bulk storage (I'm thinking either 1TB+1TB, or 2TB+another in the future).\n\nIt turns out I can and a lot of other people have done it before by making use of the M.2 A/E key slot meant for a wifi card through one of [these](https://shopee.ph/M2-To-SATA3.0-Hard-Disk-Adapter-Card-KEY-A-E-WIFI-M.2-To-SATA-Converter-Card-outdoorsoul.ph--i.1158450281.28370402670).\n\nThat solves that SATA port issue but that led me to my next concern. Where will I get SATA power if I were to use 3.5\" 7200rpm HDDs? Before this, I've only really worked with desktops and the PSU already handles that part so I don't know what are the external options like in this situation.\n\nMy research narrowed me to three options:\n\n* [12V 5V 2A AC-DC Adaptor to Molex](https://shopee.ph/12V-5V-2A-USB-To-IDE-SATA-Power-Adapter-Hard-Drive-HDD-AC-DC-i.47630197.5311508326)\n\nThis... also raises suspicion for me as I have not seen it mentioned here but I'd still like to hear thoughts and opinions about it. I plan on using my old UPS for the home lab, if that detail matters.\n\n* [An offbrand pico PSU](https://shopee.ph/High-Power-300W-12V-DC5.5X2.5MM-Input-DC-ATX-PSU-Pico-ATX-Switch-Mining-PSU-24Pin-MINI-ITX-DC-ATX-PC-Power-Supply-12V-300W-Power-Supply-i.1268132845.27768090950)\n\nLets be honest, the 300W claim seems bogus as hell but I'll only be needing around 20W so it should be fine?\n\n* A Flex PSU\n\nThis is the most expensive option of the three so far, and we're not even talking about known brand stuff. It is also the most familiar option to me but at the same time, that's a bunch of unneeded cables\n\nI don't really want to go for a USB route for now unless it really is my only choice.   \n  \nThere's also the housing/casing issue for the two drives + power source but the listings I found on the accessible online stores for me is making me think maybe I'll just settle for a 3D printing service for my exact needs.",

Sleep helps find solutions. \n\n\nI pulled down the asrock manual for that   board. The manual doesn't define the 00 error code, but a Google seems to indicate that it's a general \"something is pretty wrong, I can't even POST\" error. That tracks with what you're experiencing. \n\n\n\n\nSome thermal paste is conductive. Did thermal paste get on the board, or in any of the CPU pins? Is there paste on the CPU in amongst any surface mount components like capacitors? \n\n\nIs there a standoff in an incorrect place behind the board, shorting things out? Try pulling the board out of the case and setting it on a non-conductive surface. Does it work when not in the case at all, in a minimum configuration? Please note that the bag and foam the board came with is usually slightly conductive to dissipate static, so don't set it on them. Cardboard is fine. \n\n\nMaybe one or more of these is bad: CPU, mobo, ram. \n\n\nIs your cpu compatible with the mobo?\n\n\nIs the CPU compatible with the version of the BIOS firmware that is on the board? I know you can't know what BIOS firmware is on the mobo without another CPU to actually POST the system, but you can check the cpu support list and see if that CPU is supported for \"all\" BIOS revisions (from the beginning), or if it is only supported after a certain revision. \n\n\nIs your ram compatible with the mobo? \n\n\nIs there something wrong with the cables plugging into the board? For example, is the power button held down?\n\n\nIs there anything metal in one of the USB ports? I had a USB port once that broke inside, and the metal pins all shorted against the USB port case. Every time that happed the system went down. \n\n\nTry one DIMM in slot A1. No boot? Try the other DIMM in slot A1. Confirm that the board supports that configuration - DDR5 is a new(ish) and fickle beast. Not certain it supports single DIMM configurations. \n\n\nDefinitely do as much testing as possible in an absolute minimum viable configuration. Board out of case, only power cables connected, no video card (I saw you already tried a variant of this), no USB devices, no motherboard cables. Still no boot?\n\n\nAlso, verify that pushing that reset button on the board really does what you think it does. Try powering on via the power on switch pins. Try touching the correct pins with a screwdriver. BE CAREFUL! My thought is \"what if the case power switch is broken, and he's continually resetting the BIOS with this mainboard button? \" \n\n\n\n\nGood luck, and let us know what you find. ",

I think it's too long.)\n\n\n\nTesting going forward:\n\nAt this point, unless it poses a hazard to the components, I wouldn't be testing it in the case. If it won't work outside the case, it isn't going to work inside the case. By removing it from the case we at least eliminate the possibility that the case is shorting against the board somewhere. I would be reluctant to attach your graphics cards without the support of a case, however. I guess if you get it to boot beyond 00, then we can troubleshoot why the situation improved, and if it continues to boot the the same level once back in the case, then we can add the graphics card back in.\n\n\n\nCPU Firmware version:\n\nThe CPU should certainly be supported by the mobo firmware out of box, according to asrock's page for this board.\n\n[https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/X299%20Taichi%20CLX/index.asp#CPU](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/X299%20Taichi%20CLX/index.asp#CPU)\n\n\n\nCPU fan:\n\nI suspect it's possible that the system might check for a load on the CPU\\_FAN1 header, and if it doesn't find a fan, it may refuse to boot. I'd definitely make sure my CPU fan was attached to the CPU\\_FAN1 header, including in any minimum configuration tests.\n\nAlso, check your CPU cooler on both sides of the CPU. Is there a plastic separator (even if thin plastic) between any metal parts and the board? I know my LGA-1151 cooler had these little plastic spacers intended to go between the backplate and the board on the rear, and the coupler nuts that attached to the backplate screws on the front of the board had thin plastic stickers on one side of the coupler nuts, but NOT on the other side of the coupler nuts. So it was definitely possible with my cooler to assemble the cooler improperly and press metal against the board. The little spacers weren't really described in the text instructions IIRC, but were depicted in the diagram. The orientation of the coupler nuts wasn't mentioned at all, but I understood that it was important to not screw metal directly against the board if I could help it (except when mounting the motherboard in the designated areas, of course).",

Going to be checking it without the case now.  \nWhen i was first looking into the cause of the issue a lot of people were saying that this board was the last one made for this chipset so all bios should be up to date for this old of a chipset.  \nRam should be compatible because the mobo says it goes up to 4000 and i only have 3200 in here.  \nIt is a DDR4 board and I've tried A1 and B1 individually but i cant remember if it was with the different sticks so i'll give that a go.  \nThat button I pressed to turn it on is a power button on the board and i had tried with the case button before but to the same result so ill try with the screwdriver trick to double check that power button is working as well.  \n  \nThanks so much for the input I have definitely been struggling with the case alone as i've never built in a server case before and thats why i didnt want to pull it out to put it back in again.",

Any version number would also be very useful, as would legible, high-resolution pictures of the RAM stick labels. I imagine both sticks are the same, but since it isn't working I need to throw assumptions out the window.\n\nAsrock lists known compatible RAM sticks on this page. I drilled down to corsair, highlighted all the entries with 3200 frequency, then looked at the 32GB sticks. I saw that some variants only supported 2 sticks at once, while others supported either 2, 4, or 8 sticks. Interesting. I didn't see any RAM products that supported only 1 stick, at least officially. I still think it should probably worth with only 1 stick, but something to keep in mind.\n\n[https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/X299%20Taichi%20CLX/index.asp#Memory](https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/X299%20Taichi%20CLX/index.asp#Memory)\n\nI know that the official Asrock RAM support list is only a set of suggestions for memory products to buy, but if we know what model of RAM sticks you have, we can double check that listed known compatible products have similar features and specs to the RAM you are using. Sometimes merely being 'DDR4' with a certain frequency range isn't good enough. I've seen variants with specific voltages be required, etc. \n\nIt's definitely possible that what you have is flat out on the supported list. IDK, but it's definitely something we need to check.\n\nI read the manual and it said:\n\n\"Due to Intel® CPU spec definition, please install the memory modules on DDR4\\_A1, DDR4\\_B1, DDR4\\_C1 and DDR4\\_D1 for first priority. \" \n\nThe manual doesn't say whether you can run with just 1 stick, but it is clear that you want to put those sticks in slots A1, then B1 for the second stick. I'd definitely try with 1 stick, in a minimum configuration (nothing attached but RAM and CPU, board out of case, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\nPSU:\n\nI haven't said it explicitly, but I guess the PSU could be problematic. Worth trying another PSU if you have one.\n\n\n\nOther options:\n\nAre these parts new or used? I run plenty of used hardware myself (except storage), so I can respect the grind. Still, if used, that changes strategy a bit. You might be in a position to try returning things to the seller if new, but if used maybe that isn't worthwhile. You might benefit from buying some other parts to test with. Maybe replacement RAM, if you don't have any compatible ram laying around.",

        "body": "There are vpn protocols desgined specifically for heavy censorship countries (like China and Iran) like xray-core (which is a fork of V2Ray) but they use the same protocol VLESS. \nThe whole point is its transport layer - Reality, which is protected against detection methods like active probing. Reality can identify whether a request is coming from a censor or the actual client during the TLS handshake stage and actually either create a vpn tunnel for the client or redirect the censor to the specified SNI, so the censor would get a genuine valid TLS certificate from that website. \n\nTherefore, from the perspective of a traffic analysis system, the connection looks like a real genuine connection to the specified (unrestricted) website, because the server delivers an authentic TLS certificate. \n\nBy the way, this is also a nice way to get some free data from your mobile carrier if they have plans with unlimited data for certain websites (like social media or messengers). You can use Reality with VLESS and spoof the SNI for the mobile carrier. \n(ONLY THEORETICALLY! THIS WOULD VIOLATE THE CARRIER'S TOS!)",

    "selftext": "Here's my humble setup. 15x SAS 3.5in enclosure, 24x SAS 2.5in enclosure, hooked to a Dell PERC HBA and 36 lanes expander including 2x external ports, both cards SAS3. Plus 5x SATA drives on the side in a convenient caddy.\n\nRack is of course a DIY wooden frame mounted on the ceiling of my basement (roughly 8U), and I have a 9ft SAS cable running from one of the enclosures to the expansion card, since my server is in a room right above them. Enclosures are daisy chained.\n\nThe 3.5in enclosure is SAS only with current interposers; the 2.5in one don't use any and is still untested for SATA.\n\nMain use is a fast RAID0 ext4 array for file transfers and games for my main rig, and a backup NAS because RAID0 lol I'm dumb. Backup NAS is ZFS RAIDZ with 1 in 5 or 6 drives parity.\n\nTotal raw capacity is rather low (around 35 TB), but since I'm rather going for speed than size it suits me perfectly. Of course power consumption is what it is, but energy price is low here so doesn't matter. Expected data size for foreseeable future to range between 5 and 10 TB.\n\nImmediate projects for all this (beyond the 2 backup arrays I already have) are Windows VMs for other users in the house leveraging the fastest machine available; fast SAN for gaming computers; Immich photo backup; games server (e.g. Minecraft); and general backup/managed file hosting for everybody; Plex/JellyFin server.... Oh, and some more RAID speed testing in search for the best compromise possible (speed-size-risk), and SATA compatibility testing for the 2.5in array. And of course other shennanigans as I see fit (among which playing with cloud storage because I want to set one up for work - that's the most labby part of the project).\n\nNext upgrade is janking 10 GBE together to link 3 machines using link aggregation and 2.5 GBE routers sporting a 10 GB uplink. Because, yeah, 10 GBE base-t switches just too expensive. Not sure about link aggregation reliability/effectiveness though. Included in this upgrade would be moving the SAS management cards (including the SATA array) to another host, and set it in the basement so my office can actually cool down. XD\n\nFurther long-term projects include increasing drives capacity and setting up even faster SSD arrays, but none of that is required yet. And, of course, general mess fixing lol, including going Proxmox on bare metal because I hate having to restart everything (about 4 VMs, plus reattaching a few VHD drives I couldn't automate yet) anytime Windows princess begs for it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf0bcz786s9f1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a2cf3cc70b7613c9ba238905c926f04a6f0ae7f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyrz2z786s9f1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=532149f30e3a1a7f078bcaa17a7fba3912680fef",

    "selftext": "I decided to replace my NAS which was an old repurposed gaming PC with a new one. I wanted to build it myself for the fun, so here it is.\n\nI built it mostly out of consumer hardware as that works just fine for my use case. Chassis has 16 bays. I got 4 new 12TB disks just to start off a RAIDZ2 pool that can be expanded later. Otherwise, some highlights:\n\n* 2x Kingston Enterprise SSD (because HW PLP) for a mirrored boot pool.\n* 128GB RAM with on-die ECC (was pretty much the only consumer ECC chips I could source locally)\n* LSI 9305-16i HBA\n* Replaced all fans that came with the case with noctua fans (except the one that is attempting to cool the HBA, but I'm looking into better ways of cooling it with other noctua fans I got)\n   * Actually had to DIY a wire in order to get a signal to the 3 fans in the orange mounts using the original PCB. It had some unknown 6-pin connector for PWA + tachometer and a 4-pin molex for power.\n* Used a 2.5Gbe NIC I had lying around since drivers for this particular on-board NIC was not present until 6.13 kernel (had the same issue with another machine on Arch).\n* 2x10Gbe SFP+ NIC arriving soon.\n* Runs bare-metal TrueNAS.\n\nProbably massive overkill, but hey, it's mostly for the fun of it.\n\nNext up is either buying or DIYing a rack and moving my other two servers into the rack as well (they are currently in tower cases but I have one 4U case lying around that I can use).\n\nThe old NAS is getting some love as well and will be re-re-purposed as a backup NAS that I will place somewhere off-site.",

I would think of the network as a tree with more bandwidth at the root/core and less at the leaves.\n\nYour core can be a 10 GbE switch (e.g. the [USW-Agg](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/all-switching/products/usw-aggregation) w/ SFP modules) where your severs and desktop computers can plug in directly, then you can have a 1 GbE (or 2.5 GbE) switch plugged into that at 10 GbE (e.g. a [USW-Pro-24](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/switching-professional/products/usw-pro-24)) for your IoT devices and maybe the AP so they don't get choked for bandwidth if multiple devices are maxing out 1 GbE at the same time.\n\nThe ISP can plug in to anywhere that maximizes its bandwidth (ideally the core switch, but if you only have 1 gbit/s then it really doesn't matter).\n\nIn my case, I have a USW-Pro-Agg w/ a 2 x 25 GbE bond for my server, 10 GbE fiber connections to various switches throughout the house (Pro Max 24 PoE, Pro 24 PoE, Pro Max 16 PoE, Pro 8 PoE), and those go to a few APs (U7-Pro-XG, U6+) and secondary switches (e.g. 3 x Flex switches for cameras). Mainly use a laptop, but I have a 10 GbE TB4 cage for it when I need higher bandwidth (video editing) than you can get over WiFi.\n\nMy ISP's ONT plugs into the USW-Pro-Agg w/ a 10 GbE connection (8 gbps internet speed).\n\nI also don't think 10 GbE is that expensive right now. That USW-Agg is only $270. 10 GbE DAC cables are < $20 and 10 GbE fiber modules are $20-30.\n\nWhat \\*is\\* expensive is 10 GbE RJ45.

Made cable management so much easier and neater because it was made custom. It's also more efficient.

In the vid he used a Fractal Design FD-FAN-SSHP-120. I opted for a be quiet silent wings 4 (pwm). When I fitted the fan and powered up I found the fan was constantly reving up and down and the ilo was flapping between reporting the fan as working and failed. I decided to reconnect the old fan and found it would not spin up at all. I then reconnected the be quiet fan and it now seems to be running at a low steady rate (probably a little too low). The system is running but the ilo and the OS (truenas) are both reporting the fan as flapping between working and failed. Any idea what's going on?",

The first reason is that you don't need to install anything locally; you host it in your browser. Sure, there is the code-server (the web version of Visual Studio Code); however, I believe it to be very clunky. It's too heavy and feature-rich for something as simple as config editing. I am also not a fan of the UI, with Confix it's just one click to connect to an SSH server, with VSC it can be multiple with a larger delay. If you're using the web version, there's an annoying amount of input delay, whereas Confix is just a simple web app that does not have to stream an entire application. Confix also has better syntax highlighting specific to certain config files (It actually uses the same library as VSC, however, it adjusts the syntax highlighting depending on the file extension). It also has better theming, so instead of having to install new themes, there's a dropdown in settings with tons of different styles depending on what you like. Overall, the biggest benefits are that it's lighter, has a cleaner UI, and is more responsive.",

    "title": "Clean local hostnames with UniFi, Pi-hole & Nginx Proxy Manager (no more IP:PORT headaches)",
    "selftext": "Last week I finally hit my breaking point with URLs like `http://192.168.1.10:32400`. Sure, I *can* remember that Plex runs on port 32400… but what about Home Assistant? Or my random test container from three months ago? My brain already holds enough useless trivia—memorizing port numbers doesn’t need to be part of the collection.\n\nI wanted a clean, memorable way to reach every self‑hosted service on my network—`plex.home.arpa`, [`pihole.home.arpa`](http://pihole.home.arpa), [`npm.home.arpa`](http://npm.home.arpa), you name it.\n\n**First stop: Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM).** It’s the brains that maps each friendly hostname to the right internal port so I never type `:32400` again.\n\n**The snag:** my UniFi Cloud Gateway Fiber can’t point a wildcard domain (`*.home.arpa`) straight at the NPM container, so NPM alone didn’t get me there.\n\n**Enter Pi‑hole.** By taking over DNS, Pi‑hole answers every `*.home.arpa` query with the IP of my Mac mini—the box where NPM is listening. UniFi forwards DNS to Pi‑hole, Pi‑hole hands out the single IP, and NPM does the port‑mapping magic. Two tools, one neat solution.\n\n>**Side note:** All my containers run inside [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) using `docker compose`.\n\n>**HTTP‑only for simplicity** – I’m keeping everything on plain HTTP inside the LAN.\n\n# Why I bothered\n\n* **Human‑friendly URLs** – I can type “plex” instead of an IP:port combo.\n* **Single entry point** – NPM puts every service behind one memorable domain.\n* **Ad‑blocking for free** – If Pi‑hole is already answering DNS, why not?\n* **One place to grow** – Adding a new service is a 10‑second NPM host rule.\n\n# Gear & high‑level layout\n\n|**Box**|**Role**|**Key Detail**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**UniFi Cloud Gateway Fiber (UCG)**|Router / DHCP|Hands out itself (`192.168.1.1`) as DNS|\n|**Mac mini (192.168.1.10)**|Docker host|Runs Pi‑hole + NPM + everything else|\n\nDNS path in one breath: **Client → UCG → Pi‑hole → wildcard → NPM → internal service**.\n\n# Step‑by‑step\n\n# 1. Deploy Pi‑hole & Nginx Proxy Manager containers\n\nSpin up both services using OrbStack + `docker compose` (or your container runtime of choice).\n\n*Pi‑hole defaults to port 80 for its admin UI, but that clashes with NPM’s reverse‑proxy listener, so I remapped Pi‑hole’s web interface to port 82 in my* `docker-compose.yml`\n\nThe only ports you need exposed are:\n\n* **Pi‑hole**: 53/udp + 53/tcp (DNS) and 82/tcp (web UI)\n* **NPM**: 80/tcp (reverse proxy) and 81/tcp (admin UI)\n\nThat’s it—we’ll skip the YAML here to keep things short.\n\n# 2. Point the UCG at Pi‑hole\n\n1. **Settings → Internet → DNS**\n\n*Primary*: [`192.168.1.10`](http://192.168.1.10) (Pi‑hole)\n\n*Secondary*: *(leave blank)*\n\nI originally tried adding Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`) as a backup so the household would stay online if the Mac mini went down. **Bad idea.** UniFi doesn’t strictly prefer the primary resolver—it will query the secondary even when the primary is healthy. Each time that happened Cloudflare returned **NXDOMAIN** for my internal hosts, the gateway cached the negative answer, and local lookups failed until I rebooted the gateway.\n\n1. **Settings → Network → LAN → DNS Mode**: **Auto**\n\nDHCP keeps handing out [`192.168.1.1`](http://192.168.1.1) to clients. Behind the scenes, the gateway forwards everything to Pi‑hole, so if Pi‑hole ever goes down the network still feels alive.\n\n# 3. Add a wildcard override in Pi‑hole\n\nIn the Pi‑hole Admin UI, go to **Settings → All Settings → Miscellaneous → misc.dnsmasq\\_lines** and paste:\n\n    address=/.home.arpa/192.168.1.10\n\nClick **Save & Restart DNS**. From now on, every `*.home.arpa` hostname resolves to the Mac mini.\n\n# 4. Create proxy hosts in NPM\n\nInside the NPM admin UI (`http://192.168.1.10:81`), add a **Proxy Host** for each service:\n\n|Domain|Forward To|\n|:-|:-|\n|[plex.home.arpa](http://plex.home.arpa)|[`http://192.168.1.10:32400`](http://192.168.1.10:32400)|\n|[npm.home.arpa](http://npm.home.arpa)|[`http://192.168.1.10:81`](http://192.168.1.10:81)|\n|[pihole.home.arpa](http://pihole.home.arpa)|[`http://192.168.1.10:82`](http://192.168.1.10:82)|\n\nBecause we’re sticking with HTTP internally, there’s no SSL checkbox to worry about. It Just Works.\n\nOpen the browser—no ports, no IPs, just **plex.home.arpa**. Victory.\n\n# TL;DR Config Recap\n\n    Clients            → DNS 192.168.1.1 (UCG)\n    UCG (forward DNS)  → 192.168.1.10 (Pi‑hole)\n    Pi‑hole wildcard   → *.home.arpa → 192.168.1.10\n    NPM port 80        → Reverse‑proxy to service ports\n\nSimple, memorable hostnames and one less mental lookup table.",

    "selftext": "Hi! I’m new to this so bear with me. I’m wanting to build a home lab mainly to store my personal data and not rely on outside cloud storage providers. So far I have an 8gb raspberry pi 5, a 4TB samsung T7 and a 4TB samsung T9. I’m thinking about buying a QNAP TS-264 or an Asustor AS5402T bc USB 3.2 gen 2 ports for T9.  My thought process was to run the Nas traffic through the RPI with Mullvad VPN configured, and then use the T9 for back up and T7 for active storage. Is there anything I don’t seem to be considering? Would this be a decent set up for one user? Would you do anything differently? \nThank you for all the advice!! ",

    "selftext": "I'm still getting things dialed in, but my main use case is already up and running, so I had to share!\n\nMy old OptiPlex FX160 has had various uses for years. Currently it's running ser2net for my Zigbee dongle (for Home Assistant), plus acting as a Snapcast client and voice assist satellite. But its SSD is failing, and honestly, that machine is ancient and unreliable. I didn't want to bother replacing the drive.\n\n\nInstead, I decided to repurpose a Pixel 7 I had lying around. Rooting it was straightforward, but setting up the Linux environment, configuring ser2net, and getting USB access was a bit of a challenge. Honestly, I'm shocked it's working so well!\n\n\nWhat other cool things do you think a \"pixelsrv\" could be used for?",

    "selftext": "Hi Team\n    \nQuestion I am not sure what is best here. I am looking to replace my WD Cloud storage, where I simply store files, PVE backups and ISOs. All my files are also in OneDrive as I have as MS365 Bis account, so there isn't a lot on there. Also some media for plex but I don't download.\n    \nI currently have 3 Lenovo 720q (6c / 32gb ram / 1tb nvme) each. 2 are running K3s 1x control plane / 1x worker. The 3rd is a proxmox machine running the following:\n    \n    - AdGuard LXC\n    - Nginx svr - can be replaced with Nginx Proxy Mgr\n    - SFTP svr (for testing)\n    - Docker Registry (VM)\n    - Docker Host (VM)\n      - Postgres\n      - Redis\n      - Nginx Proxy Mngr\n    \nI am looking to replace the WD Cloud with a Synology DS723+ with 2 4TB disks running in a mirror. I plan on upgrading the ram (If I was to go with it) to 32gb to hopefully replace my proxmox machine and migrate the VMs over to the NAS. I will then make the 3rd lenovo a k8s node.\n\nI have kinda priced it up and the unit would be £450 on Amazon as a bare unit, and 2x Seagate IronWolf 4TB at £99 a pop. (haven't quoted for the ram yet) I think we the price and form factor, building a PC for the same might be a challenge (not sure) \n\nI guess if I could I would run TrueNas Scale.\n    \nHas anyone had any success with this, any tips, is it doable without any issue? I don't want to replace my WD with a DS723+ if I can't run what I am running on Proxmox. Apart from the LXC everything else is a Ubuntu Server VM.",

So when it comes to mounting those devices, it's either metal fabrication or 3D printing, whatever you have more affinity for.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rzohgivajp9f1.jpeg?width=1190&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3f9af0fa8e9302e56dae894d212fc68b3889d71\n\nThere are online marketplaces (craftcloud3d.com comes to mind as an example) where you can order a 3D-printed part if you have a design.

So assuming you get 60-80, your connection will be able to handle multiple 4k streams and many more 1080p streams. It’s plenty to work with. \n\nIt honestly sounds like you don’t know what you want to do with a home lab yet. I would think about that first. That connection speed will cover you for most anything in a home lab assuming you’re not hosting something for a ton of users. Even then it depends on the bandwidth requirements of what you’re hosting, for instance a minecraft server will use very little bandwidth per user once they’re in the game. Websites typically require very little bandwidth if they’re not hosting videos or large downloads, etc etc.",

My plan is to initially set it up to backup photos and videos from our phones (like Google Photos).\n\nThe NAS has 4 x **PCIe 3.0 M.2 2280 SSD NVME** slots. I'm looking to get started with two SSDs and setup RAID1. The max supported capacity is 4TB, but they're pretty expensive, so I would be fine with 2TB or even 1TB if it's considerable cheaper. The current Google Photos free tier is 15GB, so 1TB is probably gonna be fine.\n\nI have been looking in Amazon, and I'm a little overwhelmed with all the brands and different price ranges.  I noticed that gen4 are more expensive, but my understanding is that since the slots are PCIe 3.0, it won't make a difference... right? \n\nAny recommendations for brands/models? Any brands/models to avoid? Again, I'm trying to balance the price, since I'm just getting started here.  \n  \nThanks in advance! ",

The ASRock Z790 Pro RS is one board that makes all 8 available.\n\nI did a vaguely similar Intel build recently for an all in one Proxmox server and NAS which I [wrote up on the STH forums](https://forums.servethehome.com/index.php?threads/my-do-everything-reasonably-well-w680-home-server-uk.48081/).

I believe you can run TrueNAS Scale on the Ugreen.\n\nThe million dollar question - which should I go for?\n\nDrive wise I'm looking at refurbed drives but probably 4 x 8Tb Ironwolfs.\n\nAny advice or experience greatly appreciated 🙂",

I think it's the battery - every time I plug it into the wall, the unit turns on for about 1-2 seconds, then shuts off.\n\nI know other UPS models won't function if the battery has failed. Is anyone aware of a UPS that will continue to run and maybe give you a battery failure warning? Maybe in the form of beeping?\n\nI just assumed that's how my Tripp Lite would work. These are rack mounted devices that (in this price range) are likely powering small business operations. How is it acceptable for the UPS to just die in the case of a battery failure? I know my homelab isn't a data center...but the one thing this UPS was supposed to do...it failed at.\n\nEdit:\nI'm considering the CyberPower CP1500PFCRM2U.

The local client on that same machine communicates with the server to retrieve UPS status.\n\nOn my second machine, I only run the NUT client, which connects to the NUT server over the network to monitor the UPS status remotely.\n\nAs for the shutdown process: when a power failure occurs, the NUT server detects it through the UPS. Once the battery reaches a critical level (based on the NUT configuration), it sends shutdown signals to all connected clients. Secondary (remote) machines shut down first, followed by the NUT server itself. This order ensures the system directly managing the UPS remains active as long as possible to coordinate a graceful and orderly shutdown across the network.",

Most of them in the 1Lpc form factor have decent upgrade options (the think centers 720q and 920q are stand outs with a PICE slot). IN the states these can be picked up cheaply on ebay... YMMV in Europe but it's worth having a look.  \n\n\\> Ryzen 5825U (8C/16T)\n\nThis is a great choice in a mini-pc form factor. Your Minecraft server is going to be held back by single core performance, so this is a major upgrade over an N150.... \n\n\\> i5 12450H\n\nThis one has better single core performance but worse multi core, and uses a bunch more power. \n\n  \nIf Minecraft server is your primary use case i5 12450H, if you want to do lots of other things go for the amd. If your looking to save a buck take a look at the small form factor pc's with i5-8500 on the used market (its a good baseline)",

    "title": "New to homelab, old to IT, and I have some questions",
    "selftext": "Hello HomeLab people!\n\nI'm IT guy with lots of years of experience, but I'm struggling to start my homelab project. I have 2 mini PCs, one with proxmox and another with truenas. The first has a better cpu and 64gb of ram, the second is a 8 core intel alder lake with 32 gb of ram, lots of disk space, including HDD and NVMe drives. I have some questions, mostly because I work with cloud for many years now, and it was always easy to start and automate everything, but in homelab the automation is challenging, first because there are too many options, and second because there are too few really good options (terraform provider with more than lxc and vm creation). My main reason to create a homelab is to host my own solutions to replace some subscription services, they keep increasing prices without real benefits. I'll add my questions below and I hope you can help me to find my answers, give me ideas, suggest solutions and so on:\n\n1 - What is the most cloud-like experience I can have using homelabs without having to buy enterprise hardware or software? Are there any real solutions? (P.S.: I started thinking about using openstack, but I think it is overkill for my case)\n\n2 - How can I start automating since day 0? Is it even possible in homelabs? (P.S.: I see the doc about the answers file for proxmox automated install, it can be a starting point)\n\nI have in my mind the idea of startup solution, something very opinionated and tailored to be an easy startup to any homelab based on an initial config file, define the real basic services and then build on top of that, but even that will maybe require manual steps, like installing the first machine (I mean operating system). I came across NixOS the other day and I really liked the idea of a declarative operating system. Maybe it can be the spark component I was looking for, I don't know. I spent just a couple hours testing it and I still have a lot to learn.\nThanks in advance.",

I’m personally very happy having Ansible running services using systemd or podman but it sounds like you want GCP At Home, but that doesn’t exist.  Edit your post to be more specific.\n1. Automating what?  Setting up containers in Proxmox?\n\nEdit: overall it sounds like you haven’t actually set anything up and are pre-worrying about it not being cloudy enough - I’d suggest just doing things in a thoughtful way (eg don’t randomly install software in unreproducible ways, set up automatic off-machine backups before entrusting any use data)and then decide how much you care about this once you have a functioning system.",

Are there any real solutions? (P.S.: I started thinking about using openstack, but I think it is overkill for my case)\n\nThis all depends on what you are trying to do. I assume by cloud-like experience you mean that you want an IaaS experience which is why you are looking at openstack. \n\nI agree that for a homelab this might be overkill unless you want to keep using the tools you are used to\n\nBut as you mentioned you want to toe that line between self-hosting what you want and not paying the money that comes with enterprise solutions. \n\n>2 - How can I start automating since day 0? Is it even possible in homelabs? \n\nIt's definitely possible because a homelab is just running a lab inside your home. It's not limited to certain technologies\n\nBut I think you mean, how can you fully automate without relying on enterprise solutions. In that case I don't know. \n\nI will leave some YouTubers that might be able to help you out but maybe these solution (if this is an actual solution) might lack compared to what you are used to. \n\n- [Christian Lempa](https://youtube.com/@christianlempa?si=PU5LZTC41raRDTZh)\n  - [selfhosted gitlab utilizing CI/CD with terraform](https://youtu.be/X-Amz-Hdy8Q?si=zySHea31ycA9dEPQ)\n- [Wolfgang](https://youtube.com/@wolfgangschannel?si=AvFDmo7vq6iCeW6K)\n  - [his homelab running nixOS](https://youtu.be/f-x5cB6qCzA?si=NQOz5lGZU-dbxlZ9)\n- [VirtualizationHowTo](https://youtu.be/r5RckLwzkfc?si=XUZJNqGZVZg5ocEG)\n- [maybe techo tim. Might have to go through their videos](https://youtu.be/l9yY_VWCWlM?si=azVZiqXGUEbZolGz)\n\n>My main reason to create a homelab is to host my own solutions to replace some subscription services\n\nWhat subscription are you trying to replace. I assume you already know how to do this and your question is more around how to automate the setup to make your life easier \n\nAlot of people manually setup there infrastructure and then use PBS to backup and restore their VMs/LXC. I know it's not what you want considering you want a fully automated solution but just figured I mentioned it\n\nHope that somewhat helps. If you ever find a solution to your problem, would love to hear the end result",

And by automating I mean automating everything, from networks using SDN like OVS and having some type of MAAS to boot stripe operating systems, automate storage, backups, etc. Maybe I’m just overthinking and overengineering a simple thing. As I said in the post I already have a proxmox instance and a truenas instance, both manually installed and configured. The proxmox terraform provider looks very limited in terms of what it can do, not just automating lxc containers, but setting up all the proxmox thing, like users, groups, permissions, backup, SDN and so on. I even struggle trying to not use any cloud solution to keep the initial code, like a GitHub repo. The mais idea of my post is to have some suggestions on how to start. Thanks",
