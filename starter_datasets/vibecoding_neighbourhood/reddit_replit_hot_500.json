    "title": "Replit’s new pricing model: $350 in a single day!",
    "selftext": "(AI translated as I'm not a native English speaker.) Since July 1st, Replit has switched to a new dynamic pricing model. Tip: Check your costs regularly—one task can easily run into double digits. After each checkpoint, you can see what the task has cost so far.\n\nThe standard agent now runs even more loops and jumps straight into execution, even if you just want a question answered. It also doesn’t follow instructions very well, so tasks need to be prompted very precisely and with a clear focus.\n\nYou can now also select Opus 4—which I’ve had excellent experiences with so far. It’s extremely rare for Opus to get stuck in loops, even with more complex tasks; its intent understanding is outstanding, and instruction following is impressive. However, it’s also much more thorough, works longer and more intensively, and costs many times more than the normal agent. Everyone will have to weigh that up for themselves.\n\nThe fact is: $350 in a single day is excessive—I’ve been using Replit for several months and have never come close to that amount in a month. So of course, canceling is an option.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xljzrf5ysaf1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=950c8f3eb8ce4625ac833de4cb017be0f51b753a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxmqctf5ysaf1.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=6daf3daa1bb9c2c6cc603a4d98b3b5d4d9dc59cb",

But let me share something with you: when everything clicks, when you dedicate yourself to overcoming bugs and bridging your knowledge gaps, the rewards on the other side can be truly fulfilling. I've immersed myself in this environment, clocking in over 12 hours a day for about 30 months. In that time, I've built numerous SaaS applications, ranging from the complex to the simple, and even crafted a standout website. Most of these SaaS solutions are production-ready, though challenges like issues with Google OAuth, Stripe back-end, and other dependencies have hindered monetization.\n\n\n\n# However, over the past few days, I've conquered those hurdles. I now have one fully monetizable SaaS, just a few tweaks and tests away from launch. If it succeeds, I'll return to my other eight SaaS projects, resolve the OAuth and Stripe issues, conduct final tests, and hopefully start seeing some financial returns. After all, isn't that the ultimate goal? \n\n\n\n# It's unfortunate that Replit is undergoing another pricing restructure, leaving many of us feeling disheartened. We know how quickly negativity can spread, overshadowing positive outcomes. So, Replit, perhaps there's a pricing model you've yet to explore—one that encourages project completion and supports the execution of larger prompts, just as they did not long ago. Maybe, just maybe, you could consider sharing the success of released projects in more ways than one. After all, a small slice of something great is better than the entire market clouded by negative sentiments. Let's keep our heads up and strive for success. Peace out.",

But in no way do I know how to code and would have been able to build this without tools like **Replit, Cursor with Claude 4 sonnet, Cloudflare, 11 Labs, Github and PostHog**\n\nThe purpose of this post is to help guide others on how I went from Replit to building a landing page with voice-first AI assistance.\n\nFirst of all, why voice-first? Well, because I wanted to do something for the blinds and visually impaired. I figured the accessibility readers are good but it sucks and so, why not make a website they could, well, literally... chat to so they don't ned to read anything.\n\nBefore anything, this is not a one shot website. I took a lot of iterations. **And I haven't paid anything apart from the domain name.**\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the steps I took. Happy to dig in further on any of those if it's useful for anyone.  \n  \n1.  I started with a Replit prompt which created a very decent landing page. What I found most useful is the overall structure of the app that I could download for free.\n\n2. Then I put the app on Cursor using Claude 4 sonnet.   \n  \n3. I committed it to Github.  \n  \n4. I bought a domain using Cloudflare, created a Page directly on Cloudflare and connected the Github repo with Cloudflare.  \nNote here: .env gitignore and adding the variables on Cloudflare is something I didn't know about so took some time and Claude4 didn't help much with it. Wasted a tonne of time doing this. Now I know, it's quick. Happy to provide more details on this if useful.\n\n5. I then committed, pushed and merge a pull request (PR) which automatically fired up the website live with Cloudflare. Magic!\n\n6. From here on, I iterated a tonne with Claude4, changing every single aspect of the page as I wanted it. It's not straightforward and it doesn't always understand the instructions well (I admit maybe my instructions weren't aways the best). \n\n7. I then installed PostHog. This also took a while as I got lost and messed up + it turns out you have to wait quite a bit for it to propagate on the PostHog side. If you don't know PostHog, it's a better version of Google Analytics that I highly recommend. So powerful.\n\n8. Finally, I added an HTML plugging from 11Labs. This also took some time to actually put as div/HTML on the page as I wanted it. It turns out, using the SDK is the solution and Claude 4 was really good at that. \n\n9. I then had to prompt and add RAG on the 11 Labs side to make the AI assistant work. \n\n10. I then tested it with blind people and visually impaired and they found it amazing.\n\nNow in // my co-founder is building the backend which is WAY more complex and not something I can dare to get into. Encrypting emails alone, doing this safely and properly is taking a huge amount of work. But that's for another post.",

    "selftext": "Even better, this is now with evidence of them mishandling things, I think a class action is next.  \nI would assist in the lead if other users want to..\n\nAnyone who gets a generic email, I suggest formatting this legal doc to send.\n\n\n\n**Subject: Formal Complain**\n\n**t & Demand for Refund Regarding Unjust Agent Billing – Ticket \\[Your Support Ticket Number(s)\\]**\n\nTo Whom It May Concern / Replit Legal Department,\n\nThis letter serves as a formal complaint and demand for refund. This matter is being escalated beyond standard customer support channels due to an unsatisfactory resolution regarding unjust charges stemming from recent changes to the Replit Agent's pricing model.\n\n**Account Information:**\n\n* **Username:** \\[Your Username\\]\n* **Email:** \\[Your Email Address\\]\n* **Relevant Support Ticket(s):** \\[Your Support Ticket Number(s)\\]\n\n**Summary of Grievance:** Following the recent implementation of a new pricing structure for the Replit Agent, my account has incurred significant and unexpected charges. These charges do not reflect reckless or excessive use, but rather a billing system that lacks the necessary transparency for users to make informed financial decisions at the point of interaction. The cost of individual Agent tasks is not made clear, leading to legitimate usage resulting in disproportionate and unjust billing.\n\n**Violation of Fair and Transparent Billing Practices:** While I understand that usage-based billing is part of your model, it is predicated on the principle of transparency. A significant change in how a service is priced and metered requires clear, prominent, and persistent notification to the user. Simply updating a terms of service document is insufficient.\n\nThe current system allows costs to accumulate rapidly without providing adequate real-time feedback or cost previews for Agent actions. To bill a user under a new, high-cost model without ensuring their explicit understanding and consent for the cost of each interaction is a breach of fair business practice. This constitutes unjust enrichment, as the charges levied are not aligned with the user's informed consent or perceived value.\n\n**Inadequate Support Response:** The response received from Replit Support on \\[Date of their email\\] under Ticket \\[Your Support Ticket Number(s)\\] confirms a fundamental misunderstanding of this issue. The agent’s reply, which I have attached for your reference, dismisses my concern by citing the non-refundable nature of \"metered usage\" and offering \"best practices\" for future cost management.\n\nThis response is inadequate. My complaint is not about disliking a bill I knowingly incurred; it is about the *fairness and transparency* of how that usage was metered and billed in the first place. Offering tips on how to avoid future costs does not resolve the unjust charges that have already been levied due to an opaque system.\n\n**Demand for Resolution:** I demand a full refund or credit for all charges related to the Replit Agent feature under this new pricing model, accrued between \\[Start Date of Charges\\] and \\[End Date of Charges\\].\n\n**Intent to Pursue Further Action:** Should this demand not be met with a full refund within \\[e.g., 10 business days\\] of receiving this letter, I will be compelled to pursue all available remedies. These actions may include, but are not limited to:\n\n1. **Filing formal complaints** with consumer protection agencies (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission).\n2. **Initiating a chargeback** with my financial institution on the grounds of unfair and non-transparent billing practices.\n3. **Pursuing a small claims court action** to recover the unjustly charged amount.\n\nI have documented the charges and the communication with your support team. I trust we can resolve this matter without needing to take these steps.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Your Name\\]",

    "selftext": "**I've run several businesses and know how hard it is to balance a pricing model that keeps customers happy, fairly reflects the value delivered, and enables a company to turn a profit.**\n\nThat’s why I find Replit’s recent pricing change so disappointing. From a user’s perspective, it seems deeply flawed:\n\n* **It results in a 3–5x price hike for most normal users** (that’s certainly been my experience), *without* any change in service level. If you want the upgraded tier, the cost is now **15–25x higher**, which is **5x the new base cost**.\n* **There’s no way to forecast what actions will cost.** That’s especially problematic given Replit’s popularity with non-coders, who may not understand the system resources involved in running their projects.\n* **The new pricing is based on a nebulous “work” metric**, which users have no control over and little visibility into. Worse, there’s no guarantee the definition of “work” won’t keep shifting—so you can't even estimate the cost of completing a project.\n* **This forces users to re-evaluate whether Replit is the right platform for them—** not because of the product, but because of the unpredictability of cost.\n\nAll of this results in a collapse in trust—and I include myself in that.\n\nReplit still offers a powerful and often more affordable development environment than traditional alternatives. But that matters less if users feel they can’t trust the platform not to arbitrarily hike prices or change what they’re being charged for.\n\nMy guess is that Replit assumes:\n\n* It won’t lose more than 60–80% of its users;\n* New users won’t notice the change;\n* And the long-term revenue gains from power users will make up for it.\n\nThat may be true. But it’s a big gamble. And for many current users, including me, this move has changed the relationship entirely.",

A once-reliable service now demands 25 cents per checkpoint, only to utilize a subpar agent that executes partial prompts, potentially leaving users with potentially broken systems.\n\n# It's as if the heart of coding creativity has been shackled by these changes, justified by the introduction of two supposedly superior tiers—one at a staggering 1.25x increase and another that skyrockets costs to an eye-watering <> 6x! \n\n# Is this the price of progress, or just a mere oversight in user consideration? Curiously, the new pricing information is shrouded in mystery, shown once, then vanishing from their site as if it were a ghost in the system.\n\n# How can existing customers be left in the dark, without notification? Perhaps the elusive terms and conditions provide a loophole, but where's the fairness in that? And the feedback button, our lifeline to voice concerns about agent failures, has vanished. \n\n# Why silence the community now? Your thoughts and voices are more crucial than ever.\n\n\n\n# The current agent, assumed to still cost 25 cents, feels more like a hindrance than a help. It shattered my meticulously developed system, and now it seems I'm being held hostage by escalating costs. \n\n# Vibe coding was meant to welcome everyone, yet these changes threaten to drive users away. The loyal community, cultivated over a decade, helped Replit bloom into a phenomenon, drawing millions through shared creativity and growth. But now, what logic drives this disruption of progress, Replit founder?\n\n\n\n# We, the community, stand at a crossroads.\n\n# What are the alternatives that promise to rekindle the spirit of coding without the burden of constant fees for malfunctioning code and costly rollbacks?\n\n#  My last rollback inexplicably cost 75 cents.

    "selftext": "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK< PUSH REFUNDS< EXPECT SEAN TO CANCEL ACCOUNT\n\n# Email to Replit: Formal Dispute of Pricing Changes, Agent Performance, and Demand for Refund (Citing TOS Violations)\n\n\n\nSubject: Formal Dispute: Unacceptable Pricing Changes, Degradation of Agent Service, and Demand for Refund - Violations of Replit Terms of Service\n\nDear Replit Team,\n\nThis email constitutes a formal dispute regarding the recent, drastic changes to your agent pricing structure and the demonstrable degradation of service quality. These changes have resulted in an egregious cost increase, ranging from **200% to 700% higher**, for what is clearly an inferior and inefficient \"new agent\" experience compared to the previous model. This constitutes a severe breach of trust and, I contend, a violation of the spirit and intent of your own Terms of Service.\n\nAs an active and invested user, I have experienced firsthand how the new \"effort-based pricing\" (as you describe it) has led to significantly higher charges for tasks that frequently fail to complete successfully, require multiple, expensive retries, or yield unusable output. This stands in stark contrast to the expected value proposition of a development platform. Previously, even with the older system, wasted checkpoints were a concern; now, the financial impact of such inefficiencies is simply catastrophic for individual users and small teams.\n\nI draw your attention to the following sections of the Replit Terms of Service (as typically found in such agreements), which your recent actions appear to contradict:\n\n* **Section 5.2 - Modifications to Service and Pricing:** While this section often states, \"Replit reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. Replit also reserves the right to change its prices for any Service at any time,\" such modifications are implicitly, if not explicitly, bound by the principle of providing **commensurate value** and maintaining a reasonable level of service quality for the prices charged. The current situation, where users pay significantly more for less effective tools, directly contradicts this fundamental principle of any commercial agreement. A price increase of this magnitude, coupled with a *decrease* in effective utility, does not represent a good-faith modification of service under this clause.\n* **Section 3.1 - User Responsibilities and Service Use:** This section typically outlines that \"Users are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for their personal and business purposes.\" This implies the Service must be reasonably usable for its stated purposes. When agent functionality is demonstrably flawed and prohibitively expensive, it renders the Service effectively unusable for a significant portion of its intended purpose, especially for budget-conscious users.\n* **Section 7.3 - Refunds and Cancellations (or similar refund policy section):** While this section might state, \"All fees are generally non-refundable,\" this typically applies to services rendered and value received. In cases where the service provided is demonstrably defective, fails to perform its core function as advertised (especially under new pricing tiers), or fundamentally changes the value proposition post-purchase, the standard non-refund policy becomes unjust. The lack of functional delivery from your agents under the new pricing means I have paid for a service that has not been adequately \"rendered\" or has failed to provide its expected utility.\n\nThis punitive pricing structure disproportionately harms individual developers, students, and hobbyists who form the backbone of the Replit community. Instead of alienating a significant portion of your users, a more equitable solution, and one that aligns with fostering a thriving development ecosystem, would be to:\n\n1. **Revert to the previous, more affordable pricing model** for agents, or at minimum, significantly recalibrate the \"effort-based\" system to reflect true value and efficiency.\n2. **Introduce a clearly defined, higher-tier enterprise plan** tailored for organizations with specific high-usage needs and budgets, thereby preventing the penalization of the entire community.\n\nGiven the substantial increase in costs for a demonstrably diminished and often dysfunctional agent service, I hereby **demand a full refund for all Cycles or subscription fees incurred for agent usage since the implementation of these new pricing changes on \\[Insert Date New Pricing Applied to Your Account or Most Recent Purchase Date\\]**. This is not merely a request for a partial refund; it is a demand for restitution for a service that has failed to deliver its promised value at its new, prohibitive cost.\n\nI expect a prompt and substantive response addressing these concerns and outlining the steps Replit will take to rectify this situation, including the immediate processing of my refund. Failure to adequately address this dispute may lead to further action, including but not limited to, formal complaints to consumer protection agencies and public advocacy within the development community.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Your Name\\] \\[Your Replit Username/Email Address\\] \\[Your Replit Account ID (if easily accessible)\\]",

We build and deliver onto it. \n\nso if you wanna skip the infinite debugging loop and get your product in the hands of users by next week let's connect!\n\nI charge a nominal hourly rate and make sure you get the value delivered! you can dm me even if you need any help prompting or understanding any issue that you might have! always open to help :D\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Genuine question - \n\nI started my project as what I would call a \"vibe coder\"...just typing what I want and going with the flow. After I audited the first version of my project, I realized the backed code was all over the place (tons of mock data, things not connected together etc). I decided to restart my project but approach it in a much more methodical way. I was a front end developer in a previous life and did junior level backend work over a decade ago so I at least have a foundational understanding of how apis work, how databases are structured etc. So I took the advice of many AI developer influencers and started breaking my project into manageable features, using ChatGPT to help plan my features and prompts, and create bite-sized task lists for the agent to follow (specifically prompting it to do one task at a time). I've also gotten way better at my prompting by being super explicit about what I am seeing, providing screenshots, console errors, what I expected to happen, etc. \n\nThe new pricing went live for me on Tuesday like many others here but so far I would say it's not THAT far different than what I was experiencing before with 2-4 checkpoints per prompt (depending on the complexity). So that equated to $0.50-$1.00 per checkpoint today which is what I've been seeing so far. Granted, it's only been two days and there have been a couple checkpoints where the agent changed 1 line of code and it cost \\~$0.50 which is a bit annoying, but I may look into using the assistant more to try and mitigate that. \n\nI just wonder if those who go full YOLO mode are getting hit the most with the new pricing? Or just more vague with their prompts, using some of new extended thinking or Opus options, etc. ",

I spent about 300 hours and $600 to get the app live. I had to do a lot of re-work as I did like many, jumped right in and assumed the agent would know best practices, be a good coder, not get drunk on the job and decided to change my data model, UI, and functionality on other areas of the product. This is when I realized I had to step back and remember all of my software product manager and QA rules, I built a dev\\_rules.md document that I make sure the agent and assistant (which is useless in my eyes) use on any code changes, I caught the agent in a lie a few times. \n\nAnyway, now that I am back on track, I have seen a massive change in agent pricing the last week. I am seeing 3 to 7x the costs now for prompts. I hope this levels out as I can't take on these types of costs. The question is a good one, if the overall computting costs are going down for all the LLMs, then shouldn't the cost to run the Replit platform be going down for the Replit team? Granted I get it, elevate the costs make a lot of money, but this is also going to push many to whoever is going to do this better and at a more affordable rate.\n\n  \nIf the assistant was worth 1/25 the value of the Agent, I would use that, at this point I am questioning if Replit is the right long term place to Vibe Code.",

I wish I could just tell them, don't worry, the Replit tech team will get this done they are on it...but I can't as I don't know what is going on. \n\n  \nI was really enjoying the Replit product and I hope I still can but not being able to get anyone to respond to my begging for help, is super frustrating.\n\n  \nAnyway know anyone at Replit support they can help get me in front of them, I just need an answer and next steps.

So the Anthropic models are billed on token usage. \n\nThey give you the option to put in your own API key, so that’s what I do. As almost all my work is for custom apps for clients, the cost of the API usage is minuscule, and the benefits of having windsurf’s memories, MCP usage, and global prompt control are all worth the bit of extra cost as compared to Replit (for example).",

I’ve spent months building serious infrastructure on their platform—AI-driven automation, multi-role dashboards, recursive agent logic. What I got in return? An unstable, overpriced Agent that breaks more than it builds.\n\nThe Agent can’t follow instructions, pretends to finish tasks it clearly didn’t, and charges for garbage edits. I’ve had it \"complete\" backend work that vanished, frontend work that broke connected components, and commits pushed without permission. When you ask it to fix what it broke? That’s another charge. It’s like paying someone to punch holes in your tire, then charging again to patch it with duct tape.\n\nThey promise speed, progress, and “engineering teams” behind the scenes—but it’s been regression after regression. I’ve spent real hours debugging the Agent’s messes, documenting proof, and rewriting everything it touches to avoid total collapse of my platform.\n\nAnd now they’ve changed pricing again—with no warning—making it even *less* predictable. Their “effort-based” system means you can get charged more for the Agent’s failure loops than if you wrote it yourself. I’ve seen single-line fixes priced higher than full feature requests—and that’s assuming it even finishes.\n\nIf you're building anything real, you're better off using Claude, coding it yourself, or hiring someone competent. Replit sells the dream of full-stack autonomy, but it’s smoke and mirrors unless your project is a to-do app. And even then, good luck if it has more than three buttons.",

Because this is the first screen on my app, I'm unable to tell if any of the other requests are working, but I might try that soon.

    "selftext": "So! I'm Sid aka Doctor replit XD\n\nLast week i posted how i can help you (a non-tech founder) skip all the replit bs and technical loops and get  to launch NOW! (in a week)\n\nAbout 8-10 amazing founders reached me out and I signed 5 of them! we're already halfway there to launch next week then I'll probably share each as  a case study as well! \n\nOnce thing that's there to notice is they had a solid marketing plan, one of them was even making 300$ PM through their REPLIT PROJECT! which is insane coz this guy actually managed to not only monetize it but also get annual contracts (context : they run a organization management saas can't reveal much without permission so yeah) \n\nThat's where i understood, or realised that if i get a non-tech founder to launch, they gonna do wonders. \n\nThey were usually stuck with :   \nDeployment (site isn't showing)  \ndatabase (unsecured or sometimes data wont store like they want, non scalable)   \nBroken or low effort UI (a solid UI can really help you get that first dollar)   \nand a not having a technical partner who can actually build and handle \"absolutely anything\" that's been thought of!\n\nI'm super happy that a few months ago i decided that Product development and design was something i was passionate about and fast forward to today! I'm working with startups where I can not only develop their core product but also give in all my feedback and advise on how they could deliver something game changing.\n\nIf you think you're in a similar situation where you know the idea is a banger and the time is ticking, while the only gap between you and the dream MRR$ is replit agent going crazy / price hikes but no results / unknown techinical issues that keep coming, I can build a bridge that takes you across (this week)\n\nHMU even if you just need any help or technical advise on how to move forward or you wanna cross that gap!",

The winner is going to build a moat by scooping up as many customers as possible in these early days, not by driving them off to their competitors. Doing this sometimes means operating at a loss now, and earning it back later as API costs shrink due to competition. They must have a cash crunch, which is not a good sign at all, as they may not have solid enough financial backing. It is a good product, I hope someone there is smart enough to stop the customer attrition before it is too late.",

I’m potentially more inclined to start trying cursor Claude code. Maybe I already use codex. But Replit is a great platform. They have a database that’s easily configurable. They have a lot of tools kind of at your disposal already. They have a WYSIWYG type of system now too so yeah well maybe agent is more expensive. I think it’s also a lot better at one shot and I’m well yeah like that one shot‘s gonna cost you maybe 20 bucks let’s even say like $50 to get kind of what you really want. It looks like chat might be a little bit more useful too now so I think if we gotta use all these tools and combination it’s still pretty good platform and the monthly subscription is really low",

Replit’s network sandbox is quirky: if the package manager is blocked or your free egress port is busy, the agent keeps retrying until the health check passes, which looks like “magic” when it finally clicks. Cut that waste by opening the Shell and curl-ping the API first; if you see connect errors, bump the outbound port or add a simple requests.get test script and run it manually before letting the agent touch anything. Put your key and base URL in Secrets, set a hard timeout, and watch the logs in the debugger panel instead of the chat pane. I’ve moved between Postman and RapidAPI for quick sanity checks, but APIWrapper.ai is what I keep around when I need the agent to stub responses without extra code. Bottom line: treat the agent as a helper, not a babysitter, and you’ll burn far fewer credits.",

    "selftext": "Let me be straight with this community:\n\nIf your first instinct is to demand a refund, discredit Replit, or sabotage their reputation over recent agent pricing or mistakes—you’re in the wrong space.\nThat isn’t critique. That’s laziness dressed up as outrage.\n\nDo you hate the agent? Fine.\n\nDo you want changes? Me too.\n\nBut let’s get one thing absolutely clear:\n\nReplit is the first real platform to try and make AI-native app development possible—for everyone. \n\nAnd we do not fix a flawed foundation by burning down the house.\n\n⸻\n\nYes, Replit Has Problems.\n\nI’ve been one of the most vocal people about them:\n\n\t•\tAgent runs loop.\n\n\t•\tToken/context caps cripple real devs.\n\n\t•\tPricing is experimental, unpredictable, and yes—sometimes exploitative.\n\nI’ve posted the breakdowns, the evidence, and the receipts.\n\nBut here’s what I haven’t done:\nI haven’t tried to make Replit the villain.\nBecause Replit isn’t the problem. The lack of pressure from us is.\n\n⸻\n\nWe Need to Push Replit—But Not Punish Them.\n\nReplit needs to hear us. Loudly.\n\nWe need user-first policies.\n\nWe need fair pricing that reflects outcomes, not retries.\n\nWe need agent visibility, sandbox controls, context transparency, refund logic for AI mistakes.\n\nWe need more than slogans. We need infrastructure that actually works.\n\n\nBut all of that only happens when we build with them, not against them.\n\nThis platform is still a beta vision of what could become the most powerful dev environment of the decade. We are early. They are early. There are going to be missteps.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nIf your idea of rebellion is “get a refund and leave,” go ahead—bow out. That’s not activism. That’s quitting.\n\nBut if you believe in what this could be—what we could build—then get loud, not bitter.\n\nContribute, don’t cannibalize.\n\nRefine it, don’t refund it.\n\nBecause if Replit fails, it won’t be from their mistakes.\n\nIt’ll be because the people who should’ve fought to shape it, walked away instead.\n\n\nLet’s build the future we were promised.\nNot tear it down because it’s still under construction.\n\n— Your Usual Replit Criticizer",

That’s how I ended up trying Claude, specifically Claude Code (the same model Replit’s agent is based on).\n\nIt’s not as user-friendly since it runs through the terminal, but when you pair it with Cursor and a browser to preview your web app in real time, it becomes a very capable dev setup.\n\nI’m currently on Claude Pro (not Max). The tokens don’t run out that fast, and the wait time isn’t terrible—but still, I’m genuinely considering upgrading to the $200/month plan. Not because I need it, but because having complete freedom to work without any limits feels like a solid investment. Honestly, more appealing than Replit’s current pricing.\n\nSo props to Replit—every little obstacle just leads me to better tools and new ways to grow. Migrating hasn’t been easy, but it’s been worth the journey.",

Easy, done. No other added tool. No other added mechanism.\n\nYou are somewhat aware- I hope- that these other systems that don’t include these catalog of features work- they work BECAUSE they don’t include these catalog of features correct?\n\nThere is the work load, costs, development, etc.\n\nClaude Max can give you what you want as a specific user for $200 because it isn’t the suite of features nor does it market itself regardless as a one shoe fits all.\n\nReplit does.\n\nReplit doesn’t work because of it.\n\nand now there is a movement to move away from Replit and to combine tools, instead of working with Replit to upgrade the singular tool.\n\nI couldn’t imagine what people could create if Replit worked at 100% capacity, AND THEN people started combining tools. Not before, but guess we’ll never know as people are too scared to tough the hard process.",

User authentication works fine with the default [`repl.co`](http://repl.co) URL, but when I route through my custom domain (e.g., `https://useoptionvista.com`), the login fails and authentication doesn’t complete.\n\nI reached out to support and was informed that the issue might be related to how **REPL\\_ID mapping interacts with Passport strategy resolution**. The ticket was escalated to a backend engineer, but it has now been **over 6 days** and I haven’t received any updates.\n\nThis is preventing me from launching the app publicly. I’ve completed all other steps, and authentication is the last remaining blocker.\n\n**Would appreciate any guidance or updates from the Replit team.**  \nAlso open to temporary workarounds if there’s a known fix or config tweak.\n\nThanks so much!",

It's not perfect and the agent still does absolutely stupid shit however, I am optimistic with what these tools can do and a high tide can rise all our boats. Some of these tips might be obvious but thought I'd share in the event it helps you/the community.\n\n* Create a an instructions template to live in your attached\\_assets folder\n   * So when directing the Agent ask it to ALWAYS follow that format when asking it to do anything\n   * Mine looks like\n      * 🚨 MANDATORY: Review REPLIT\\_AGENT\\_INSTRUCTIONS\\_1750827119767.md AND FOUNDATION\\_FIRST\\_DEVELOPMENT\\_PRINCIPLES\\_1750828502008.md and follow all protocols.\n   * TASK: \\[Input TASK\\] (there's other items in checklist that it must do like check existing schema/APIs before completing the task etc)\n   * Always create a new chat with the Agent for any task.\n   * Always tell it you will approve its plan first.\n* Add a BRD document to the same folder (your vision) When I feel the Agent is starting to be a fuckhead, I will ask it to re-familiarise itself with document.\n* Add both Design System and Brand Style guide documents as [README.md](http://README.md) files. (typically I will do this in the inital/first App prompt).\n* Only ever ask the assistant to compile reports and reviews. Don't let that little shit change anything. It always has a knock on effect which corrupts other outputs/work done. I typicall get it to analyse codebase, features, functionality and make recommendations. Then, I will get a phased roadmap with explicit instructions to complete the phases from the assistant.\n* As someone said previously, PLAN, PLAN, PLAN - I would have all this work done before even creating anything.\n* I am sure I have forgotten things.\n* To misqoute Orwell; Break any of these rules sooner than doing anything outright barbarous.\n\nThese are things that helped me deliver [PickWell.ai](http://PickWell.ai) (shameless plug)\n\nOf course, all these things might be a placebo effect to help me cope with the trauma of the product just not up to what it's supposed to be (and paying for the privilege). Which makes me the sucker.\n\nHope this helps. Keep on building.",

No report button, no kebab menu, nothing.\n\nReplit is awesome for quick prototyping, but this is a **real problem**.  \nPeople often copy/paste fast (vibe coding), especially beginners — and they could easily run something malicious without even realizing it.\n\nRight now, **anyone can publish dangerous code**, and unless you go line by line, you’d never know.  \n**No reporting tools + no protection = unsafe for regular users.**\n\nAnd yeah — you should always audit your code and have a pro review it. But let’s be honest: **most people won’t**. Not here. That’s just Murphy’s Law.\n\nNow imagine launching a company or client website using a public Replit snippet you thought was clean — but it’s hiding something malicious.\n\nWhen things go wrong, **who takes the hit?**  \nThe person who snuck in the code?  \nOr **you** — because it’s your site, your brand, your name on the line?\n\nThat’s the real danger.  \n**Replit needs to step in and fix this.**",

Also -- you can absolutely go back to a closed chat from your history and rollback to that point.\n\nIf you are not sure look at the checkpoint and click on the screenshot \"Load Preview\" and it will open up a new tab with the code as it existed at that point in time so you can decide if you want to roll back to that checkpoint or not.\n\nNext up - create an account on an external git repository (GitHub is but one, there are plenty others) and use the built-in git feature to synch your changes to an external place every so often.  There's a whole lot to learn about git but there are \"branches\" and you can have a \"main\" branch where all the code is up to a known-good state, use that to create a \"working\" branch ... make some changes and then after you are satisfied that your changes are ready for prime time pull them up into the main branch.  In Replit with git set up you can click the \"Sync with Remote\" button which is kind of the same thing but a level down (internally Replit uses git to make those same checkpoints and rollbacks)",

It has a semi accurate budget and tool list,  It even has a mostly functional interactive map .  even if I were to ask questions that could legally get me in trouble.

I believe the website that I’ve made mostly uses type script but it also has things like C plus plus and JavaScript so I wouldn’t know how to run this off anything but sandboxes like Replit AI.

The Agent's broader context prevents small changes from becoming significant issues, and now they're more affordable.\n\nOne thing we're losing in this new pricing model is the ability to chat with the Agent for an hour discussing an implementation idea, then get detailed instructions in a Markdown document for 25¢, which can be fed to the Assistant.\n\nBy the way, I racked up that $1.41 charge by chatting with the agent for 20 minutes about implementing a feature, requesting documentation, and then agreeing to do all that.  I feel obliged to \n\nI consider myself a fairly informed Replit user.  I know when to cut bait and rollback to start a line of reasoning over, I know how to investigate the errors myself and point the AI to the root of the issue, I know to never start without a plan in place, and I know to keep careful tabs on the output.

Though the last time I tried this it didn't really get anywhere. I fear I need an expensive and experienced human\n\n\\---\n\n* **Pick a framework-standard CSRF solution** (depending on your stack):\n   * **Express.js**: Use `csurf`\n   * **Flask**: Use `Flask-WTF` or `flask-seasurf`\n   * **Django**: Built-in\n   * **FastAPI**: Use a CSRF package like `fastapi-csrf-protect` if you’re using forms/cookies\n* **Apply it to all POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints** by default **and whitelist only those that must be** (e.g., public APIs that don’t deal with state/auth).\n* **Document clearly** which endpoints are whitelisted and why — you can give this to a future dev and it’ll save them hours.\n* **If stuck, get a dev to review just the CSRF setup now** — not the whole app. This might cost you 1–2 hours of freelance help but avoids building on an insecure base.\n\n# ",

Use Git pane for branch management:\n\nAlways use the Git pane (in Tools section) for switching branches\nDisable auto-run before switching branches to prevent stale cache issues\nVerify your changes are synced by checking the Git pane status\n2. Utilize checkpoints effectively:\n\nThe Agent automatically creates checkpoints at logical milestones\nCreate manual checkpoints before making significant changes\nUse \"Rollback to here\" option if you encounter issues\n3. Clear cache when needed:\n\nOpen your Repl in a new private browser window\nClear browser cache and cookies if you see stale content\nEnsure all team members are working on the latest version\n4. For Express + Vite projects:\n\nKeep your .replit file configuration updated\nUse different ports for Express and Vite servers\nCreate checkpoints after successful builds",

    "selftext": "I’ve been working on something that I think could really help newcomers (and even experienced users) navigate Replit more effectively - an Interactive Replit Guide built entirely on Replit using Streamlit + Python.\nWhat I’m Building:\n\n\n\t•\tComprehensive guide covering everything from basic setup to advanced features\n\t•\tInteractive tutorials and hands-on exercises\n\t•\tReal-time code examples and explanations\n\t•\tTips for optimizing workflows and avoiding common pitfalls\n\t•\tAdvanced prompting strategies for the AI Agent/Assistant\n\n\nWhy I’m Sharing This:\nAfter seeing so many posts here about confusion with Replit’s features, pricing changes, and AI agent usage, I realized there’s a real need for a centralized, interactive resource that goes beyond the official docs. Something that actually teaches you how to become proficient quickly.\nWhere I Need Community Help:\n\n\n\t1.\tWhat topics are you most confused about? (Agent vs Assistant, deployment, database setup, etc.)\n\t2.\tWhat mistakes did you make when starting out that a guide could have prevented?\n\t3.\tWhat advanced techniques have you discovered that aren’t well documented?\n\t4.\tCommon pain points you’ve experienced that need better explanation?\n\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n\t•\tBuilt with Streamlit for the interactive interface\n\t•\tUsing Python for backend logic\n\t•\tImplementing modern UI/UX with custom CSS\n\t•\tPlanning to include real-time code execution examples\n\t•\tWill have both beginner and advanced tracks\n\n\nCurrent Progress:\nI’ve got the basic framework up and running with several sections completed. The guide includes interactive elements, progress tracking, and even some gamification to make learning more engaging.\n\n\nHow You Can Help:\n\n\t•\tShare your biggest Replit learning challenges\n\t•\tSuggest topics that need better coverage\n\t•\tIf you’re interested in testing/feedback, let me know!\n\t•\tPoint out any gaps in existing resources\n\n\nI’m not trying to compete with official documentation - just want to create something that bridges the gap between “total beginner” and “Replit expert” in a more interactive way.\n\n\nUpdate: I’ll be sharing the guide with the community once it’s more polished, but would love input during development to make sure it actually addresses real user needs.\n\n\nWhat do you think? What would make this most valuable for you?",

So vibe coding is all I've got and I'm eager to learn.\n\nI used replit to build an app for logging and invoicing payments in a niche industry, and after much revision and testing, my app was functioning exactly as I wanted. I attempted to add Replit Auth so that users could have individual profiles, saved settings, logs and invoices, etc. But adding this completely broke the app. I am now rebuilding all the functions that were revised to get to the checkpoint before adding user authentication. \n\nWould it have been better to start with user authentication and build from there? Is there a way to add auth without having to rebuild everything that was already working? I tried rolling back to the last checkpoint before adding Auth and changing the prompt multiple times, but every time it results in going back to the drawing board.",

        "body": "I don't necessarily think you have to start with authentication.  My most recent app I didn't.  I built it for personal use and then implemented authentication later.  Adding email/password authentication went relatively smoothly, but then implementing additional Oauth types (LinkedIn) is where I started to have things break.  In the future, I'd probably go ahead and initiate a prompt that I was planning on adding additional authentication methods, so at least [replit.md](http://replit.md) would note that.\n\nI think the main challenge with adding it after the fact is really fleshing out for Replit agent what exactly is going to be behind authentication and what needs to be database information and what's hard coded.\n\nOne of the ways I did that is by doing this:\n\n\"Everything you have right now works great - I like how it looks, how it works, and I don't want to break anything or make any visual/functionality changes.  But, I have this information on my dashboard/website and I need to be able to access it from anywhere - let's store it to a database.  *(Sometimes apps can try to store stuff locally and then you change devices or browser windows and it's gone - we don't want that.)* And then, I want to be the only person that can access my dashboard information using an email and password.  That way, I can visit a login page, input my credentials and see my dashboard - also, we need to have smooth logout functionality!  So, I login, I see the working exactly as it is app, I logout (it clears my session) and I see a login page.  \n  \nThen, once that's working.  Let's create a system for other users to create accounts with an email address and password also.  We should have a system for users who have forgotten their password, too.  We also need to verify user's actually own their email address.  We can use a SendGrid API for that *(or in my case I used my own private SMTP credentials)* to send a verification email or forgotten password emails.  Then once a user has created an account they should have access to their own dashboard with their own data and can logout.    \n  \nLet's make sure we use best practices for security.  Let's make sure private user data *(you may need to tell it what data you want)* is stored encrypted. \"\n\n  \nThat's basically the prompt I used and then I had to go verify.  Unfortunately, when I first added on an email scraper system, I was having users input their IMAP credentials and that was getting stored in plaintext, which I didn't realize at first so that was a nightmare because I had to then have new database tables created that were NOT plaintext and Replit kept trying to do a migration instead of just forcing deletion of those tables, but it's all figured out now.",

The debugging after that work probably took another 15 minutes and it works as it should now.\n\nIn general I think it's better if you have a general understanding of the core functionality you want in your application to provide architecture insights and use cases as you build it. This way you won't get stuck in the details at first, but things won't completely break once you start implementing those details.\n\nFor the record, I am not a developer myself, I'm a product guy. I think it might be working to my advantage as I usually limit myself to functional descriptions and leave it to the developers to figure out the best technical implementation to achieve those results. My technical interventions with replit have been more related to debugging and figuring out what might be wrong with the architecture design. Just thinking out loud here :)",

Safely refactor the app to support multiple authenticated users, so each user has their own data isolated from others.\n2.

So it is definitely possible to do, and frankly it isn't necessarily wrong not to add multi user support straight away as it is common to want to test the main functionality first. So think this may be more down to how you ask it what to do. Asking it to add replit auth without context may be an issue. I have also seen it get tied into knots with adding the user auth/token auth to the routes, and in one project found out rather too late that it had hardcoded my first test user ID all over the place! It also didn't secure the routes initially, just passing user ID in, and getting all data and filtering by user ID on the front end. Horribly insecure. So it's important to specify that routes need to be user authenticated.",

Then, you can work inside the individual services without being as likely to affect the others, while still having the context there. \n\nAnd you can also pull the app down locally and deploy each service separately to have a better debugging experience and allow you to scale certain pieces without having to scale others. \n\nFor example, I have an app that has a user panel for showing reports/analysis for a client’s SEO. That panel does not need a lot of horsepower, so it’s deployed separately from the api and the AI analysis engine. Those bits get more resources and have scale-ability while the front end is just on the lightest weight little hosting.",

At first it feels like it’s expensive, and yes it gets frustrating at times with the errors it produces or the looping or re-prompting required until it can actually fix a simple problem. BUT, I’ve never before been able to ship so fast or prototype solutions so fast than before. I have days where I have 2-3 tabs open for apps that are being built, while I’m either on calls,\nor working on something else, I would have needed support from other people that would cost me at least 20-30x / month. In summary, it’s not perfect, from an error free experience, but it is a very cost effective way of shipping apps and hosting them as well. The fact that Replit has its own infrastructure where I can deploy apps and auto-scale compute is also a big+ for me vs. hosting code on a virtual machine on AWS or Google Cloud. Speaking of which, for those on Cursor, where are you hosting (aside from localhost) your apps ?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone — I just started at a company at the end of May. They have an existing software but needed a new one for an expanded client need. Shopping around to dev agencies for a MVP, we were quoted $68k/month with a 12-month contract. Company didn't really want to/nor could afford to spend that yet so I decided to give replit a go. \n\nI’m a product manager with no prior coding experience, but I leaned hard into Replit, and in 2 weeks, I launched a functional MVP that’s now being beta tested by 6 different teams. \n\n**What I’m looking for feedback on:**\n\n1. I want to move production out of Replit but still use it for rapid development/staging. What’s a clean setup for managing multiple environments and deployments?\n2. Can I continue to do this myself? We are a lean team so I may not be able to hire many people but if I hired one role what should it be?\n3. Are there any parts of my stack that seem fragile or overcomplicated for scaling to 1000-1500 users?\n4. Open to any other feedback, suggestions. I want to make sure this system is stable and can scale and I'm not going to wake up one day and have a nightmare on my hands. \n5. Am I crazy? lol\n\nHappy to share more screenshots or details if helpful. Thanks! App details and tech stack below:\n\n**Total Cost:** $226  \n  \n**Platform goal**: serves as the intermediary platform where event organizers can efficiently find and manage temporary staff through established staffing agencies that we manage.\n\nKey Features:\n\n* **Calendar-based scheduling** with shift management\n* **Real-time notifications** in app and email\n* **Automated timesheet workflows** with approval processes\n* **Invoice generation** with PDF exports\n* **Airtable integration** for importing event data from client system\n* **Role-based access control** ensuring data security (4 user role types)\n* **Email automation** via SendGrid for communications\n\n**Tech stack (all TypeScript):**\n\n🖥️ **Frontend**\n\n* React + TypeScript\n* Wouter, React Query\n* Tailwind, Shadcn/UI + Radix\n* React Hook Form + Zod\n* Lucide Icons, date-fns\n\n🧠 **Backend**\n\n* Node.js + Express\n* Firebase Auth (recently replaced Replit Auth)\n* Express sessions + PostgreSQL store\n* Multer (uploads), XLSX (Excel parsing), node-cron\n\n🛢️ **Database**\n\n* PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless)\n* Drizzle ORM + Drizzle Kit\n\n🔌 **External services**\n\n* Firebase Admin SDK\n* SendGrid (email templates)\n* Airtable (for syncing legacy data)",

        "body": "I don't think scaling up will be the problem from a performance standpoint, scaling up for me has always been a problem of the type of users you eventually attract.\n\nI had a WordPress blog for example that had about 30,000 visitors per year and went for years without issues because I wasn't really changing anything other than frequent normal updates and adding blog posts.  Tech doesn't tend to have a mind of it's own unless you start flipping switches (or making prompts).  WP can be pretty performance intensive as it doesn't cache by default among other things, so personally I took time at optimizing WordPress sites, but at the end of the day throwing more server power at a project to keep it live under heavy traffic is the easiest part - and Replit has auto-scaling to do that.\n\nWhen you're garnering thousands of visitors, you start attracting malicious visitors and I started to deal with attacks outside of just your typical bad bot trying to do DDOS or SQL injection on a rogue outdated plugin.\n\nAnd the main problem, especially for people who have no prior coding experience, is that you really don't understand the underlying components and tend to trust false positives or negatives.  That's really what you're paying for with a developer who charges $68,000 a month for a full stack system - peace of mind and intricate knowledge of where things tend to get abused by malicious actors.\n\nAs your app becomes more complex, the possibility of something getting overlooked increases (especially if you don't know what you're looking for).\n\nIf you have the budget to have your code reviewed by an ethical hacker, that's probably a good place to start, especially if you are intent and have the possibility of this growing into something big.  For the most part, I feel like Replit does some good measures for basic security, but there's been a few features that have been implemented that resulted in a \"what the hell are you doing that for\" response from me - like when I integrated an admin panel and didn't realize users could have changed their account type from user to admin just from manually inputting an API endpoint URL.",

    "selftext": "So, I come from some coding experience, which I feel like has really always boiled down to \"let me go ask the community at Stack Overflow\" how I can do this without a plugin.  It seems like every mom and pop show around me is using WordPress, so that's where most of my experience has been skewed to, but in short, I can understand what Replit spits out - at least enough to figure out the logic, connections, and verify through existing documentation on the web (whether those IMAP settings the user inputs client side are actually being stored encrypted server side for example).\n\nReplit for me has been more of \"I can now do this in 3 days\" instead of \"this will take 3 years by myself\" and more \"I can learn from reading the changes it makes\" than \"I don't even understand why it's making those changes\".\n\nThat said, I keep seeing people say with these \"vibe coding\" tools that the best approach is to break things into little parts, but I really (and this could be anecdotal) feel like my best success has been when I just feed it a very detailed, very structured, very full encompassing input as a prompt.\n\nAnd I'm curious if anyone actually feels the same way.\n\nI hesitate to write this, because I don't want to share with the world a \"tutorial\" that sends people in the wrong direction, but honestly when I look back and think \"alright, I'm going to build an authentication system first and then I'll add this feature and then I'll add this feature and then I'll add this feature\", I end up with this absolute mess that breaks.\n\nWhereas, I feel like (and I can't stress this enough that this is anecdotal), if I take a few hours to really flesh out my idea from start to finish, trying to think ahead of every little component, and then feed that to it in a very structured way, my result is that my last 20% is just some visual changes along with verifying (and changing as necessary) that hard inputs are actually dynamic and using database queries.\n\nI could be wrong (and that's why I'm stressing that this is anecdotal for a 3rd time), but sometimes I feel like just having a full scope of work input, then saying \"don't break what's there, but here's the full scope of work and are you missing anything\" has been way more successful than \"okay, let's do this now...\"\n\nDoes anyone else feel that way?",

So I have an entire file I call my articlewritingguide that I feel like is able to write some really human sounding stuff.  But to do that, I have to prompt it with personalities, topics, categories, randomization, RSS feeds to help pick up trending content, pain points, etc.  So what I'll have this file do is reference lists of topics that can then get fed to OpenAI with the prompt to not use that topic title exactly, but change it based upon all these \"seeds\".  And those topic lists, transitional phrases, pain points, trust factors, RSS feeds have lists of 100s of lines of inputs, and so that gets changed every time, but the underlying methodology to how the article is written uses the same concept from project to project.\n\n  \nI also have a file that I setup for a prompt for demos, because they can be kind of tricky in that there's a lot of different ways to handle demo data.  A separate demo database can be a challenge, remixing into a demo subdomain comes with challenges, and just using the built in database can be a challenge.  So what I ultimately decided (and I like to use instant demos a lot because I hate the give us your email approach), is to create a demo-\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*@mydomain.com account and then just do an automated cleanup every 20 minutes to delete demo data.  Generally, between wiping it and enlarging the community to minimalize the demo data, that works well and is pretty repeatable.",

    "title": "Do AI agents ever actually learn from mistakes?",
    "selftext": "I’ve been building a few small apps recently, mostly quick MVPs to test ideas. The most annoying part is when the AI keeps repeating mistakes I already fixed earlier. Same broken logic, same bad output, and I end up wasting time and money fixing stuff I’ve already dealt with.\n\nI’m using Replit for most of it because it’s fast to get started, but I’m starting to think about switching things over to something like Cursor or just working locally. Maybe that gives me more control or helps avoid the agent getting stuck in weird loops.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Like, how do you get consistent results without having to handhold the AI every few minutes?  How are you are managing this kind of thing without burning out or redoing the same work nonstop? Share your thoughts, thanks.",

        "body": "I have a ton of experience dealing with this. There are a couple of ways to deal with it. I, too, have used Replit (and lovable, bolt, v0, etc) to create fast prototypes, and they're great. I've since moved to downloading projects, using Claude Code inside Cursor to manage them (and using GitHub ->Vercel to deploy). The way I try to help them make fewer mistakes is by telling Claude to write up markdown (.md) files about how the app works, features it intends to build etc, so it can use them as a reference. I also pay attention to what it's doing each time so I can learn how the app works and make suggestions when things go wrong. One issue I run into a lot is that it wants to use camelCase for variables when supabase tends to use snake\\_case. I can see if it's writing variables in one way or another, and I remind it not to do that. Giving it files to reference about schema, cases, etc helps it make fewer mistakes. Also, the context window helps. If you try to troubleshoot the same issue in the same thread/convo, it remembers all the things it tried. If you come back to it later in a new thread, it might not. Hope that helps!",

Use a PRD, be direct, and always always always tell it “Do not make changes.” It’s second nature at this point. First month when I was raw dogging it, I blew through $25 bucks in like 2 days. This last month I built a full app in Replit and I didn’t even break $13 after I couldn’t tell you how many feature adds and debugs. If you’re on TikTok or YouTube, follow Opichi, that’s where I learned everything that’s saved all those credits. \n\nAnd like the other commenter, I pull down to local too, I use KiloCode (VS Code). Wouldn’t suggest building directly from there. Lovable turned out an exceptionally better first build when I compared the two with the same PRD. Good luck!! ",

As someone who's been a PM and worked with a lot of devs over the years, I still find this process faster and about the same amount of effort as the old process.\n\nThe old process is: Come up with a feature, describe it in great detail, assign it to a dev, wait for them to build it, test it, find a bunch of bugs and UX problems, reassign the changes, repeat that cycle a few times because devs are bad at QA, and then eventually get what you want. Even though the build-test-fix loop is still there with AI, it's on demand and typically requires less instructional work on the front end. So ultimately, it's faster and easier for me. Not to mention cheaper. Paying Claude $100/month vs a dev $50/hour is a huge deal to me.",

I got my basic site running with the free replit credits. 3 pages, a contact component I use on a couple of pages.\n\nI created a GitHub with 2 of the same versions I cloned from replit. I got ChatGPT to help me get the replit AI agent to do this seamlessly. I can even branch should I want to make bigger iterations.\n\nI created a supabase DB, then again used ChatGPT to help me with integrating with replit. When ever I got a little stuck, I got ChatGPT to help me write specific prompts for Replit AI.\n\nMy home page has, headline, sales pitch and  2 components - a quiz funnel card, and a direct lead card. Then I have testimonials section. I got replit ai agent to help with this, but used ChatGPT to give instructions. \n\nAll my pages have a header and footer, they use the same component globally. Again with replit agent but leveraging ChatGPT \n\nI changed the original style replit  built. This was a little frustrating but I got there in the end with ChatGPT, and got ChatGPT to write me strict instructions for replit on how to restyle the site. I gave chat gpt replits cheat sheets so it can advise me and give me prompts to fix the problem at hand based. You can obtain this from the replit site. \n\nI created a list of bugs and problems I want to fix by manually checking them on the current version. I then got ChatGPT to help me figure the most important ones to fix to least. The easier fixes I just used Claude or ChatGPT to help me and did it manually in replit. But got ChatGPT to keep track of the changes and create me a .md. When I have made the changes and they worked, I then fed this .md to replit and asked it to note, and update the manual changes in its own replit.md. (Important to make sure that before you do manual changes to get replit to do a snapshot and pushed the current version to GitHub). \n\nFor harder fixes, I Then asked it ChatGPT to create me prompts for each one separately for replit agent. At the bottom of each prompt I make sure to include that only focus on the task that I am wanting it to do, and to only change what is necessary. For the exact wording I leverage ChatGPT or Claude.\n\nMy site is not super difficult, it’s a lead generator really. But the ui is quite complex and I’m also not using replits DB as I wanted flex ability and also I wanted to make sure I can scale on my own terms. And actually move off replit completely if I wanted.\n\nA week ago I paid my first replit subscription, the basic one up from free.\n\nI have made loads of iterations since then and have just hit my $25 limit. I have it capped at $10. I am now waiting for my renewal to get in with harder iterations. Anything else I’m doing manually with ChatGPT and getting replit to update its .md for future reference.\n\nSo far costs have been $25 for replit, nothing for supabase, free Claude, and I use ChatGPT for everything so I put half of that monthly subscription towards this site. \n\nMay not work for everyone, and I am pacing myself.  but I have a near complete site that all works with database and GitHub. And I’m trying to streamline my workflow and pipeline so I am not spending loads of money. \n\nTo note: I am not a coder, what I do know i have learnt over the last 3 months using ChatGPT, Claude to build some things locally, I used flutterflow and now replit. \n\nSo I do know how to now read basic coding just from this. But think you have to. It’s pointless just expecting AI to do everything but not at least know the basics so you can debug a little yourself. \n\nI am enjoying replit",

Then try again with more detail and maybe a note about what went wrong last time.\n\nAnother common issue is leaving too much up to the AI to figure out. Work on smaller pieces at a time, smaller ideas. If you do bigger ideas, provide clear details on what you want, or what the issue is.\n\nI've been a dev for 20+ years so I admit to having an upper hand and not being able to put myself in your shoes. My guess is though that you need to start this project over, or \"refactor\" (rewrite) some of your more complicated files/features. Don't put good money after bad.

    "title": "Building a business with Replit as the backbone is fun",
    "selftext": "I’ve been teaching a course for the last few months and am up to Cohort 15 starting next week. I focus on building an entire business. I teach how to use over a dozen AI platforms for setting up a business plan, strategy, sales, marketing, and everything else you need to build a business (product with paying customers).\n\nAnd I use Replit to pull it all together and build the product. I’ve tried the other systems out there like Lovable, Bolt, etc, but Replit is winning big time for me. It just seems to be the easiest to learn for people that don’t know how to code.\n\nOne fun thing is that every single time I teach the course, I build something new. I don’t intend to run all of these businesses, but I build out cool stuff and I’m very tempted often to push forward and build these as real businesses! Here are a few that I have built with Replit:\n\n- AI Proficiency Institute - https://genaipi.org (actually running this business)\n- BYU football and basketball fan dashboard - https://cougariq.com (not finished, but the Past Games section is fully functional as well as the Cosmo AI)\n- RV rental marketplace - https://road-share-rental-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (just a concept)\n- Assistant for experiential stay - https://oupost-x-amira.replit.app/ (actually live and working for Outpost X right now as a pilot)\n- Priorities alignment dashboard - https://personal-catalyst-flowstatejon.replit.app (just a concept)\n- Life alignment assistant and tracker - https://priority-tracker-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (beta app for a friend)\n- Insurance risk management dashboard - https://risk-analyzer-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Personal digital travel pin board - https://global-trek-tracker-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Movie buffs hangout spot - https://cinevia.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Book writing tool - https://scribeapp.replit.app/ (polished concept)\n- Pool builder website - https://verdepools.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Flow State Retreats - https://flow-transformation-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept in development)\n- Recreational vehicle insurance site - https://revanainsurance.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Construction takeoff software - https://construction-takeoff-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (complex app with lots of python scripts running in the background that were built by Manus and then compiled by Replit)\n- Piano sheet music subscription service - https://sonare-sheet-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Home mortgage shopping site - https://mortgage-master-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Course marketplace (standalone concept of something now part of GenAIPI - https://course-marketplace-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept)\n- Life skill factory game view - https://life-factory-manager-flowstatejon.replit.app/ (concept)\n\nIf you want help building something, feel free to reach out. I also appreciate ideas and feedback on all of these concepts and projects! I have about 20 more projects like these.\n\nMany of them were built during the courses I teach, so I have no intention of actually launching these businesses. But if you want a remix of any of them, just let me know and I can share.",

Like, basically, I had to input a whole check list of SEO - then verify with GSC - and then continue telling it to tweak things.  Most of it seemed to boil down to situations where it was still referencing the replit development domain instead of the deployment domain.  That was pretty frustrating, and so in some way's I'd agree, but I totally think you can build a system that performs well in search also if you spend probably the same amount of time and money as was spent building the app to enhance the app with good SEO.",

We had a big demo scheduled today for which our team was trying hard to spin up a prototype and almost the night before the demo, things didn't go as planned as the application we are building is quite complex and needs for the chatbot to generate complex SQL queries from natural language chats to retrieve data from a large complex database to answer user queries. It was clear that next day was going to be a disaster and not knowing what to do, I decided to finally try out replit, having wanted to do it for quite sometime.   \n  \nWith the help of Claude and Replit, took about 4 hours in the night to create a working demoable prototype and it came out even better than what we were trying to showcase on our own. Not only did Replit save the day, we turned around a disaster demo into a winning one and the client was pretty impressed. Ofcourse the demo worked pretty well on a smaller dataset of the larger database and the fact that we had already designed the required architecture for the bot to work with high accuracy helped.   \n  \nThe real challenge still lies ahead in building the NL2SQl solution on a large database system which I am still not sure is doable through Replit. May be the Replit team here can suggest / assist.",

    "title": "F2Insights - Your final two week notice in sight with job search insights.",
    "selftext": "Being a job seeker in today's economy is powerful.\n\nCountless sites aggregating positions, remote work opportunities, salary statistics compiled for community inputs, and a wealth of research and knowledge at your finger tips to empower you to raise the bar on your career.  And yet, much like in the world of online dating where it feels like it should be objectively easier to find exactly what fits into our life, many people feel frustrated - overwhelmed by options, unsure how to nail down what they're looking for.\n\nIn my own ambitions, almost 2 decades removed from the job hunt, I found myself stepping into a world full of multiple round interviews, jobs only marketed on certain sites, virtual interviews, multiple people involved, and a desire to consolidate all this power that existed on sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, my notebook, contact list, and figure out a way to consolidate it.  Most options I found weren't exactly what I was looking for, lacked features, or wanted to focus entirely on shoving AI resume builder services down my throat.\n\nSo I built my own with Replit - a sales funnel, an ERM if you will, that takes all of the things I love about my own endeavors in organizing projects on the career side (KPIs, follow up tasks, work flows, AI automation) and focuses it on career advancement.\n\nAnd now, I'd like to share [F2Insights.com](http://F2Insights.com) with the world.\n\nWhat problems does it solve?\n\nImagine you're a waitress and you'd like to become an anthropologist.\n\nFirst, you head over to F2Insights and you input your current position and tell it your future endeavors. The Career Pathway feature uses OpenAI to guide you by providing a curated path to follow, along with milestones, job titles, and advancement tips, breaking your big goals into baby steps. Based upon your pathway, it suggests Research Assistant is a good place to start and now it's time to apply.\n\nThis is where F2Insights really shines!\n\nLet's imagine you've applied to 50 different positions at various job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, CareerBuilder).\n\nIt can be a lot to organize!\n\n*When is that interview you had scheduled? Did you remember to follow up with Nancy in HR? Has it actually been 14 days since you applied to the Acme Museum? Do I need to login to Indeed or LinkedIn to track that application? How am I going to find the time to send 35 follow up emails? Is this even normal to get 1 interview out of 50? Is this job even worth accepting with an hour commute?*\n\nF2Insights aims to solve all these problems with a variety of tools that help you through the process: Companies -> Applications -> Interviews -> Offers\n\n**- The Email Scraper -**\n\nEach time you apply for a position, job boards will send you an email notification. By securely linking your email account (via GMail or IMAP), F2Insights will intelligently parse your emails, pulling job application confirmations into the system as a new job and company, streamlining your ability to focus on applying and worry about importing into F2Insights later.\n\nPretty nifty, eh?\n\n[\\(PS - User email settings are saved encrypted via a 32+ character key, NOT in plain text!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2paoe5q9u3af1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e1d3e6021f7f9563d399d6c95417d9ece5aaab4)\n\nNow that you have a job application in the system, it's time for F2Insights to get to work. With scheduling features, contact tracking, smart ToDo system to automate tasks associated with each application, communication/activity logs, and notes, keeping track of applications is a breeze! But we don't just want to track, we want to know if what we're tracking is even worth tracking! And that's where Insights come into play and positive feedback loops reign supreme. F2Insights keeps your future in sight with intelligent insights!\n\n**- Insights -**\n\nUsing both external and internal data points from other user's, F2Insights can help you see whether salaries offered are reasonable, if your response rate is in line with averages, what the general job market difficulty looks like, whether you hit your personal goals of applying to X number of jobs this month, and more - all fueled by an ever analyzing AI!\n\nBut data only does so much if you just passively apply. You need to be a proactive, job hunting machine!\n\nAnd F2Insights has a tool for that as well.\n\n**- The Batch Emailer -**\n\nSo you've been hitting that apply button quite a bit lately or maybe you've even looked the hiring team in the eyes once at an interview. But now, all you've heard is silence.\n\nAccording to [LifeShack.com](http://LifeShack.com), it can take up to 200+ applications to land a single job. And according to random Redditors, upwards of 1000+...that's a lot of follow up emails!!!\n\nF2Insights makes it easy, by consolidating all of your stagnant applications and interviews into a list after 7 days of non-activity. Simply click a check box next to each contact you'd like to follow up with, click Generate Message (or write your own using a variety of contact variables), and with one click you'll send out a highly personalized (and seemingly straight from your own email address) follow up message to all of them all at once with a reply to email header that sends back directly to your inbox.\n\nOn the receiving end, it looks like you took the time to write it out specific to their company, but on the sending end, you're click, click, clicking and done.\n\nAs a bonus, a single tracking pixel will help you know whether your email is even getting seen, so you stop wasting time on positions that are obviously ignoring you versus just not getting opened.\n\nTo check it out, simply click the \"Instant Demo\" button to get a feel for the platform and play around with it.\n\nI'm just getting started!  Note, some of the features do require a subscription, given they tie into OpenAI which cost credits per use, but I've tried to find a reasonable balance that isn't greedy and provide the variety of features unlimited and absolutely free.\n\nAlright, go check out [F2insights.com/demo](http://F2insights.com/demo)\n\n**Technical Details**\n\nAs a community site with paid features and potentially sensitive data, it was really important to me I took security serious.  Some of this is implemented by default, but I also took liberties to verify.  For example, by default, when a user connects their IMAP settings, it was storing that information in plaintext, so I implemented an encryption key\n\nPasswords are encrypted server side and SSL is forced.  Email addresses must be verified to access the site and also when an email address change takes place.  Password resets require current password and forgotten passwords use an email token.\n\nThere is CORS configuration, input sanitization, and rate limiting in place.  Stripe implementation is PCI compliant and in order to manage your cards/account on Stripe, we securely connect to retrieve it rather than keep that information locally - so you get Stripe security with a seamless experience.  Connection pooling, Drizzle ORM SQL injection protection, and encrypted connections to PostgreSQL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kc1pmp1y74af1.png?width=1866&format=png&auto=webp&s=a13c8ce4ce3b6685d32b2a7d55e26d93afd34282\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8t41lhcr94af1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb7ded54a1ba8bbb4c5a69db6e78023d5c52d33f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrfk7eey94af1.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b7d524d8c6cc7059a2c20d519cda205e59e054c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ks6ld8dba4af1.png?width=1827&format=png&auto=webp&s=987cd5719c1a2df05ccf8b2dbece7b255d89d9bd",

But I’m determined to get it working as a good learning experience for my next project!\n\nTwo Issues:\n\n1. I’m struggling to convert PDF/DOCX to txt. Does anyone know of a free API that’ll do this? Or documentation I can read which will give me the answer\n\n2. I thought it would be useful for people to paste the link to the job they want, I can scrape the website and grab job details. Then at the end you’ll have a perfect CV/Resume. I’ve been blocked from scraping (surprise) anyone have thoughts on this?\n\nHelp would be great appreciated\n",

My wife has always loved African design and traditional artisan work, but Malawi has a certain magic to it. The economy is one of the poorest in the world, thus we wants to help create, support, and provide to those who lack resources. \n\nWe are manufacturing stock now. The business is mainly directed for Wholesale suppliers but there is also e-commerce functionality to the business as well! \n\nBackground: I started a renewable energy Pay As You Go business in Malawi and have always had a strong business acument. \n\nFeel free to AMA.\nI wanted to share to receive feedback! \n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "First it’s important to note that I have been a product manager (somewhat technical) for coming on 16 years which means I have been in the trenches with software teams as we find paths and solutions through deep and unplanned complexity whilst being relentless in making sure we don’t lose sight of business value and ROI.\n\nIt feels like tools like Replit were built for me and as such the landscape has shifted. \n\nI am now able to build simple revenue generating products without engineering support but when I do the time and distance to communicate complexity has radically reduced and it’s brought me closer to engineers. Closer to their workflows, closer to code - and likewise engineers feel closer to product and business value. \n\nI am an optimist at start and what I am experiencing is a radical shift at all levels of software product design and process - and I’m excited. The road is tough, a lot of trial and error but I’m building design systems and Agentic first experiences in hours not days This can only be a sign of progress and will welcome an acceleration of innovation.\n\nI now build a working product or feature at leader twice a week. A few highlights:\n\n- animated charts that visualise and find patterns in complex data (3 hours)\n- quality trends in software ticket writing and AI ticket writing improvement (4 hours)\n- 4 corporate landing pages (ranging from 3 hours to  a couple of days)\n- an Agentic first SDR tool that scans, researches and scores business profiles for sales teams so they focus on ideal customer profiles (3 days so far)\n- an Agentic first accelerator for Soloproneurs (my baby and work in progress) \n- Micro SaaS tool that quickly shares your free time in multiple time zones to help find meeting slots and crafts an availability message - by integrating with your calendar and leveraging LLM (50mins) \n\n\nIf you want to check out my work DM me. If you have an idea reach out - I’d love to help. Time and cost to visualise your idea is no longer a barrier. \n \n",

This is a known Replit issue that sometimes occurs after production deployments.`\n\nIs there a way to achieve what I want, and if so, how should I proceed. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

But, for rapidly validating components and showcasing transparent development, it's a great collaborative tool.\n\nCrowdfunding on Indiegogo lets us build with the community—not just for them.

When someone asks for gift recommendations, it doesn't just ask one AI - it asks 5-6 different AI \"experts\" and combines their answers and gives the best possible product recommendations. \n\nTakes about 10-15 seconds to get really thoughtful recommendations  \n  \nThe agents are:\n\n* A bargain hunter\n* A psychologist who understands personalities\n* Specialists in different product categories\n* A cultural etiquette expert\n* A logistics expert for delivery\n* Someone who remembers your gift-giving history\n\nI’m pretty proud of it. I am not building it as a long term business or anything (obviously). I’m currently between contracts and it's my “look what I can do” piece of work. Content marketing, I guess. I’m still perfecting the image generation (currently pixabay API).   \n  \nWould love feedback please! ",

    "selftext": "Have you ever been frustrated by constantly repeating yourself, making typos, or typing “FIX THIS” over and over again?\n\nThat happens to me all the time. When I’m coding, I make typos or write prompts that aren’t clear. I keep going back to old versions because the AI didn’t understand me and made the wrong changes. But in reality, it wasn’t the AI’s fault. It was my prompts.\n\nThat’s why I created a Chrome extension that can enhance your prompts with one click, without leaving Replit. You’ll never need to switch tabs again.\n\nHow it works:\n\nYou write your prompt and click the “Enhance” button on the textarea. The extension reads Replit’s system prompt and acts like Replit to refine your prompt, making it more understandable and in the best format for Replit, so you get better results.\n\nGive it a try and share your experience in the comments 👉 [https://promptdc.com/](https://promptdc.com/)",

It sounds like you've put a lot of work into building your app's backend, and now you're looking for a smooth way to handle deployment and complex frontend features like real time chat and data visualization. \n\nOne no-code/low-code platform that might be a good fir is Knack. It offers a pretty comprehensive all in one solution where you can build databases, design user friendly frontends, setup workflows., and integrate APIs without writing code. It also supports real time updates and has good options for charts and dashboards, which could help with your data visualization needs. \n\nThat said, there are a few big players in the no code space you might want to explore too, depending on your specific needs:\n\n Bubble- great for building highly customizable web apps with complex logic.  \n OutSystems- more enterprise focused low code platform with strong backend and integration capabilities.  \n Appgyver- a powerful visual builder with strong focus on mobile and webapps.\n\nEach has its pros and cons, but if ease of use and combining backend and fronted quickly is a priority, Knack is definitely worth checking out. Plus, its API and integration support means you can still connect your existing backend services. \n\nHope that helps, and good luck with your app!",

Hear me out.\n\nWhat if Replit *intentionally* gets you 90% of the way to building your micro SaaS, but never quite to the finish line?\n\nThink about it: if you could spin up a marketing site, build your app, deploy it, and walk away with a hands-off income stream for a year, where would their revenue come from? They make money *every time you log in*. The more you tweak, fix bugs, and chase down weird platform-specific issues, the longer you stay subscribed.\n\nBut once your product is done and stable? You leave. You stop paying. You stop debugging.\n\nSo maybe it’s not a bug that your app starts throwing mysterious errors right when you’re about to launch. Maybe it’s the business model. Keep you *just close enough* to believe you're almost there, but always one deploy away from success.\n\nIt’s like the pharmaceutical industry and cancer. The money isn’t in the cure — it’s in the *treatment*. Replit doesn’t profit off your success. They profit off your struggle.\n\nWould love to hear others’ thoughts. Anyone else feel like Replit is the digital equivalent of “infinite beta”?",

Exactly why I'm working on a new app that has an always free tier as long as you don't mind it having a link to allow others to build,  if you do you can buy your own domain and completely disconnect from my service. My approach is we grow with you, not we rob start-ups. Thank you for this post, it inspires me to keep it free and remember where i was before it all started 👍🔥🔥",

Most of it was spent copying and pasting from ChatGPT and then Claude. So it wasn’t really “vibe coding” as we’d call it now. I built things one module or function at a time. So I did learn a lot about how everything works as I put it together. \n\nMaybe if I had first been introduced to it recently I would feel differently. But for that year I used Replit for an average of 4 hours every day (while holding down a day job) and I told anyone and everyone that it was the best tool I’d used in a long time. The one click environment set up, SQL database creation, object storage and deployment are pretty amazing and really lower the barrier to entry. After a while I thought I’d try out Pycharm and that experience of not knowing how to set up my own interpreters and virtual environments really cemented just how seamless Replit makes it to start creating things. \n\nSo for that reason I’m always going to be a big fan.",

Claude code does too of course. You can use Claude in Cursor. I’ve used them all and run into the same issues with all of them. \n\nSo I don’t get why Replit becomes such a lightning rod for criticism. None of these tools can create software from a few prompts and a PRD. They all fuck things up, over engineer, favor testing and mock data over actual solutions, create project bloat if unchecked, re-invent the wheel constantly if unchecked, etc etc. \n\nIt’s not limited just to Replit.",

This means you can use your free Gemini/OpenRouter API key and build apps in Dyad for free.\n* **Runs locally** \\- Dyad runs entirely on your computer. Because your code lives locally, you can easily switch back and forth between Dyad and your IDE like VS Code, Cursor, etc.\n* **Open-source** \\- Anybody can contribute to Dyad's code. Want to change something about it? You can fork it!\n\nDownload Dyad for free: [https://dyad.sh/](https://dyad.sh/)\n\nIt's totally free and works on Mac & Windows and Linux (download Linux directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/dyad-sh/dyad/releases)).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback!\n\nP.S. we're launching on Product Hunt today and would appreciate any support 🙏 [https://www.producthunt.com/products/dyad-free-local-vibe-coding-tool](https://www.producthunt.com/products/dyad-free-local-vibe-coding-tool)",

    "title": "Replit’s AI Agent: Why the “Mistakes” Might Be the Business Model",
    "selftext": "A couple weeks ago, I posted a breakdown here about how Replit works: yes, you can build real apps, yes, you can make money, but the platform is fundamentally designed to extract dollars from you—not empower you. Since then, I’ve dug deeper. What I found? It’s not just about pricing tricks or “oopsies” in the agent. The whole setup might be intentional, and here’s why.\n\n\n1. The AI Model Choice: Not an Accident\nReplit uses Claude Sonnet for its AI agent. But here’s the wild part: Sonnet is the weaker sibling in the Claude family. Claude Opus 4 Extended (the flagship) can generate 5,000-8,000 lines of code and read 80,000+ lines at once. I’ve tested this myself—Opus 4 Extended is a beast. Sonnet? Not even close. And Replit doesn’t just pick the weaker model—they throttle it even more, capping context at 8,000 tokens (when Sonnet can actually do much more elsewhere).\n\n\nWhy would they do this? Because a weaker, limited model makes more mistakes. More mistakes = more “fixes” = more billable agent runs. It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.\n\n\n2. The “Mistake” Economy: How Replit Prints Money\nLet’s be real: Replit’s revenue exploded from $10M to $100M+ ARR in half a year, and it’s not because the agent is that good. It’s because every failed agent run, every loop, every “try again” is a new charge. People are burning $100+ a month for broken code, while other tools (Cursor, VS Code + Copilot) deliver more for less.\n\n\nThe agent gets stuck, doesn’t see your whole codebase, loops on the same bug, and you pay every time. If you don’t micromanage it, you get burned. That’s not an accident. That’s the business model.\n\n\n3. Is This On Purpose? All Signs Point to Yes\n\n\n\t•\tArtificial limits: 8,000 token cap, even though the model can do way more elsewhere.\n\t•\tDynamic pricing: A/B testing $20, $25, $30, $35 Core plans to see what users tolerate.\n\t•\tNo refunds: If the agent fails, you eat the cost.\n\t•\tCommunity “support”: Users flock to Reddit/Discord to find hacks and workarounds, which just deepens the sunk cost.\nIt’s like a casino where the slot machine is rigged to almost win, so you keep pulling the lever.\n\n\n4. Why This Matters\nIf you’re a new dev, you’ll think you’re just “not using the agent right.” But the system is designed for you to overspend while chasing the AI dream. If everyone used it perfectly, Replit’s revenue would tank. The mistakes are the business.\n\n\n5. What To Do?\n\n\n\t•\tUse Replit as a tool, not a magic wand.\n\t•\tTrack every agent run, and use the assistant for small stuff.\n\t•\tDon’t buy the hype—compare with Cursor, Copilot, or just run Claude Opus directly if you can.\n\t•\tShare your stories. The more we talk about this, the less power these tactics have.\n\n\nBottom line: Replit’s agent isn’t “broken”—it’s working exactly as intended. The real bug is trusting the marketing.",

In reality, we allow the context to grow even above 100k tokens.\n\n- we are launching support for Claude Opus 4.0 next week. As others mentioned in the comment, Opus is 5X more expensive than Sonnet… hence why we default to Sonnet.\n\n- our financial incentive is for users to successfully build apps and then deploy them on Replit. Therefore, the entire premise of your (AI-generated?) post is invalid.",

        "body": "I assume the reason they use Claude 4 Sonnet is because the business model and pricing was built when 3.5 Sonnet was the best Anthropic model. When Agent was first released, 3.5 Sonnet was $3 / $15 per million tokens (input and output respectively), which is the current pricing for Claude 4 Sonnet, meaning they can move from 3.5 (or really, 3.7) to 4 without incurring additional cost. \n\nClaude 4 Opus, on the other hand, is 5x as expensive, at $15 / $75 per million tokens.It's simply unrealistic to assume that Replit would be able to adopt a 5x more expensive model and not dramatically increase the pricing to the user.\n\nThe same logic applies to capping the context size. While prompt caching dramatically cuts down on cost, the longer a thread goes on, the more expensive each subsequent message sent to the API gets, as you need to resend the entire history of the thread back for the LLM to know what you were already talking about. I assume Replit probably uses the checkpoints as moments to cache the conversation with the API, so that getting the history of the conversation up to the checkpoint costs $0.30 / MTok, so for each new input message (until the next checkpoint), you're paying $0.30 / MTok (for the cache) and $3 / MTok (for the part of the conversation after the last checkpoint), which means that as the chat goes on, it gets progressively more and more expensive for each input message. In that world, they just can't give you unrestrained access to the full context window , as filling up the full context window would make the single input message that hit the 200K window cost them $0.60.\n\nLet's assume that I had a back and forth conversation with Claude 4 Sonnet over 10 back and rounds, in which I would send 10k tokens and Claude sent me back 10k tokens. In that situation, after all 10 rounds are done, the full 200k context has been filled. That 10 round conversation would cost $4.50 (assume no cache for simplicity)! If they wanted to give you more access to the context window, the checkpoint price would have to dynamically increase as more of the context was used up.\n\nThere is a reason why all of the other agentic coding tools had to adopt new pricing structures recently.",

Therefore, conspiracy.\n\nRight, because there’s no way they might be optimizing for latency, cost, or performance across tens of thousands of simultaneous user sessions. Nope. Clearly they just sat in a room and said, “How can we slightly cripple our tool to frustrate users just enough that they keep paying us, but don’t ever finish their apps? That’s where real money is.”  \n\nAlso, they’re clearly rolling out Opus 4 support right as we speak.  And I’m grateful they’re rolling it out SLOWLY.   When lovable moved from 3.5 -> 3.7 overnight (clearly without thinking it through all the way), they fucked up a lot of people’s apps and many people churned.  I’m one of them.  Stability is king. And building stable tooling takes time and patience.  I might suggest learning some patience.  \n\n> “More mistakes = more money.”\n\nNo, more mistakes leads to more churn.  That means less money.  You have this exactly wrong, especially with so many other quality competitor messing the same space.   I churned from lovable to Replit because of the sheer quantity of errors in the 3.5 -> 3.7 move.  What kind of stupid ass business model would program in mistakes?  The correct answer is none. At least not be design.  .\n\n>> “No refunds.”\n\nWelcome to literally every SaaS, AI, tool, API, and cloud service since 2012. Try getting a refund from OpenAI when your GPT call sucks because your prompting sucks.\n\n>> “It’s like a casino.”\n\nIf you lost your life savings to Replit, maybe you shoulda watched more YouTube videos on prompting.  \n\n>> The solution? Use it wisely. Don’t believe the hype. Compare tools.\n\nSo . . .  be an informed consumer and a smart user? Use the product as a product and not divine revelation? Bold stuff. Revolutionary.\n\nYou’ve basically uncovered that a freemium dev platform… has incentives… and isn’t a charity. Shocking.  Truly shocking revelations.  \n\nAlso, having a Replit employee fact check you publicly and responding with “but my research?!?!” is a bad look.",

I've started to pause the project so that I don't go over budget and just wait for my billing cycle to end. It sounds lame and cheap, but Replit isn't my only subscription for this project. I'm paying for 4 different subscriptions, and I can't just blow money on this agent because it can't fix simple issues. Replit will be rolling out its \"Effort-Based Pricing\" July 1st and I'm just...shaking my head right now. I'm using this service because my coding skills are not going to work on this particular project, and I'm still learning. I'm just coming on here to say that you are not the only one noticing this.",

        "body": "Michele, I appreciate you jumping in, but let’s clarify with evidence and user experience:\n\n\n1. Token/context limits are real in practice.\nWhile you claim “no 8,000 token cap,” user reports consistently show that Replit’s agent struggles with larger codebases, often failing to read or reason over big files and returning context/memory errors. Multiple reviews and threads cite an “8000 token cap, up to 20x lower than the base models when accessed through every other platform,” and users specifically complain that the agent can’t cross-reference or process large files, even though Sonnet’s raw capability is much higher. If the technical cap is higher, users aren’t experiencing it—so something is limiting effective context.\n\n\n2. Opus is 5x more expensive than Sonnet—true—but users deserve transparency.\nOpus 4 currently costs $15 per million tokens, while Sonnet is $3 per million tokens, a 5x difference. But the real issue is that Sonnet’s limitations (especially with context and reasoning) lead to repeated agent mistakes and more billable runs, which can cost users far more in the long run. If Sonnet can’t handle a task in one go, users end up paying for multiple failed attempts.\n\n\n3. Financial incentives and refunds:\nReplit’s own documentation and numerous user reports confirm that there is no refund policy for failed or broken agent runs—even when the agent makes mistakes, loops, or damages projects. Many users have asked for refunds after significant credit loss due to AI errors, and consistently report being denied. If your incentive is user success, why not offer refunds or rollback for obvious agent failures?\n\n\n4. Evidence and user experience:\nEverything I’ve posted is based on direct user experience, public documentation, and widespread community reports—not AI hallucination. The fact that you’re now launching Opus 4.0 support confirms that Sonnet’s limitations were real and recognized by Replit. The pattern of repeated credit burn, lack of refunds, and agent context issues is well documented by users and independent reviewers.\n\n\nIf Replit’s goal is truly user success, then transparency, accountability, and user-first policies should be front and center—not just marketing claims. The community deserves honest answers and real solutions.\n\n\nCitations:\n\n\n Reddit: Buyer Beware—Replit’s AI Agent Review - https://www.reddit.com/r/replit/comments/1fahuge/buyer_beware_replits_ai_agent_review/\n\n\n Helicone: Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 Technical Review - https://www.helicone.ai/blog/claude-opus-and-sonnet-4-full-developer-guide\n\n\n Baytech Consulting: Replit—An Analysis of the AI-Powered Cloud Development Platform - https://www.baytechconsulting.com/blog/replit-an-analysis-of-the-ai-powered-cloud-development-platform?\n\n\n Reddit: Has anyone received refunds from Replit after serious AI agent failures - https://www.reddit.com/r/replit/comments/1l5102y/has_anyone_received_refunds_from_replit_after/",

I haven't run it yet because I am worried about costs, because of hearing / seeing people talk about the cost, but I can't seem to find anywhere concrete that would suggest it could be more than $100 per month.

To plan for future growth without disrupting current functionality, I used Claude/GPT to map out the full project architecture in advance — including technical specs and prompts.

Would it be possible to take the core architecture and design and run it through Claude and see if you could rebuild it with all the functionality that you need?

I tried no code tools and found them to be more trouble than they were worth. I also didn’t like how learning for one platform meant you were stuck there - the knowledge isn’t particularly transferable. But learning some basic python is never a bad idea. \n\nAnyways, Replit is way easier to use than Claude code. I wouldn’t describe Claude code as particularly appropriate for no code or low code users. There’s no hand holding. If you want to use it in the CLI for an IDE like Pycharm or even cursor, you’re going to have to set up your entire environment. Replit handles that for you. \n\nClaude code is great. I think Replit is great. But if I’m just starting I would use Replit. Then once you’ve built the foundation and are more comfortable using an IDE, you can push the repository to GitHub and then move it over to an IDE and use Claude Code.",

I'm wondering if I could make this whole process go even faster (...lol) if I *really* got the initial prompt right.\n\nI had ChatGPT o3 craft a prompt for Replit by looking through some rough notes about what I wanted and the existing process, so that first prompt was pretty extensive about what I wanted to create, but all of the tweaks I had afterwards weren't really part of it.\n\nI'm wondering if I should spend even longer fleshing out that first prompt, to maybe get \\~95% of the way there right out of the gate.\n\nAnyone have any relevant experiences to share about this? Is it possible to get 95% with the first prompt if you *really* nail all the functionality, or are you always going to get a nice MVP produced but then spend a while adding on additional features after that?",

And I think this is where it messes up the ENTIRE application.\n\nI noticed this across all the apps I made. So now I guess that if we start with authentication first, establish how the user starts their journey from the pricing page - so build this first, then payment, then registration or whatever and then a basic dashboard (or the other way around, most likely, as we start from the end and work backwards).\n\nI will try this over the next few days in a new app I am building (hey, I am addicted!) and update this.

How would I let them know it exists (where the cost of obtaining a customer is less than their lifetime subscription)? Is the maintenance/ running cost lower than the subscription revenue. Etc. ie, the business case. If that stacks up, then you build software. Having said that, Replit let's me build great POCs to test the above, but I minimize the time and effort on the POC until the business case is validated.\n\nGood news: you may still have a great idea that people will subscribe to. I would probably explore more than pure technical options (more than SEO). I might look at a poster at every gym in my area, to get the early adopters on, and try to stimulate word of mouth - eg with refer-a-friend strategies. There are lots of ways to skin this cat.\n\nYou need to think \"who are the people who will use this\". And \"why will they use it, what are they really after\" (eg maybe they are not looking for fitness gatherings, they are looking to get fit). And \"where do these people hang out (physically and digitally)\".\n\nMarketing is hard. I hope this helps. Good luck.",

Do I think it's a waste of money? No. \n\nThis big app I've built in replit is already by far and away better than the $100k and 3 years I've spent with a development company developing what my vision is for the (admittedly complicated) app.\n\nEvery prompt you write, consider all of the meetings and back and forth with developers, project managers, business analysts, etc. \n\nThe $5.00 spent on 'wasted prompts' is 10 times less than I would have spent on coffee and donuts for a meeting. \n\nAI is quickly democratizing software development. But you need to understand (or use AI to help prompt) the basics of web development to be successful at this point in time. You must also know basic troubleshooting. Watch the dialog the agent is giving. Notice the terms it uses. While it's running the agent, open another chatgpt or similar window asking what it means. What's lazy loading? What's optimistic updating? What's a route? What is object storage? What's a bucket? When do you want to use these things? \n\nTake what you learn by what the agent breaks down from your natural language prompt and start using the specific terms. Use assistant for fine tuning. Break prompts into small specific pieces. Prompt to update documentation every time you add new features - update features, schema, architecture, readme, etc. When you see hallucinations, have the agent/assistant refer to the documentation. \n\nHope this helps! I get that it can be frustrating spending money on wasted prompts, but these tools are just incredible and cost far less than the traditional route.",

I first built a shopping app but it became apparent very quickly that it was way too complex. \n\nSo now I'm building a routine builder/  task manager type app that's much more straightforward. I was amazed at what it built at first but it seems like every button I click on has issues. Often it doesn't do anything at all or doesn't work as intended. I have to flag issues all over the place, usually multiple times for the same/ similar issue. I don't trust that anything actually works so I'm spending hours testing and flagging issues. Sometimes issues that were once solved are broken again later.\n\nDoes this seem right? It feels like it should be more automated or programmatic to check for errors. \n\nLet me know if I'm missing something, which is totally possible since i'm such a novice. Thanks!",

    "selftext": "Just wanted to give back to the community by sharing how I’m now handling Replit in my dev process. Replit is still god-tier for prototyping. I can get a stunning MVP or proof-of-concept up and running insanely fast. It's perfect for a functioning MVP and excellent interface. But it's also hell-tier when you hit those deep, random, cascading bugs, especially the ones that show up right at the end, after you were certain it was done. I've lost full weeks trying to untangle those, even on just semi-complex apps.\n\nThis last barrage of issues was the last straw, but nothing beats Replit for the first stage; so I’m planning on changing my workflow, if it’s more than just an MVP or simple tool. I'm going to use Replit to build the initial version fast, then immediately move it over to a proper setup with real infrastructure once it works. That way I get the best of all worlds: speed, beautiful frontend, solid backend, and reliability.\n\nHere’s the new workflow:\n\n* Prototype and build MVPs on Replit (fastest path to working UI + logic)\n* Once it works, export the project and refactor in VS Code with GitHub Copilot\n* Deploy the backend using Fly.io, Render, or Railway \n* Deploy the frontend using Vercel or Netlify\n* Use GPT-4 or Copilot Chat to help fix bugs and clean up logic\n\nStill love Replit for what it does best, and have gotten far better at it (in part thanks to this sub), just not depending on it past the MVP phase anymore. \n\nHope this helps anyone having similar experiences.

Some of these data tables will be used for the logic in my estimating module. And I would like this to be interactive to where in the future we can add or subtract data from it. This is similar to my current ERP system we are using. I'm not sure if it's easier just to keep all of these complex data tables in the back end or if I can continue building them in the front end.\n\nI have spent more time asking the Replit Agent/Assistant to fix bug issues on how the lists behave more than any other complex feature!\n\nThe goal is that when the user clicks the edit action button on the right hand side of the list row, all contents within that row are then editable. Then to save the user will click the check mark in the action column. Lists that are more navigation based tend to not have any problems with edits, but the lists in the data tables seem to be giving me more problems.\n\nI'm not sure if my post makes sense but I'm just looking for some insight and help.

    "selftext": "Been coding since the early '80s, neural nets for stock market prediction since the '90s, and I’ve built trading and analytics tools at pretty much every level. So when I say Replit Agent is *absurdly productive* for building MVPs and fully functional apps, especially if you know how to guide it right, I mean it. I can get complex, working apps done in a couple of days that used to take teams a week. \n\nBut.\n\nEvery so often, something that should take 5 minutes spirals into 5 hours. Tiny-seeming issues trigger cascading bugs, and you’re suddenly deep in some nested mess of rollback, partial module rewrites, and debugging interactions that weren’t even part of the scope.\n\nToday was one of those days. All I had to do was integrate the client’s trading platform API, make sure it prioritized live data over Yahoo Finance fallback, and confirm it's updating in real time. Should’ve been a 1-hour task at most. But then Replit Agent introduced subtle bugs, while I recognized other trivial things that also caused bugs, a 2FA system started throwing inconsistent errors, I recognized smoothing artifacts on the chart got weird, and everything started colliding. I rolled back. Then forward. Then back again. Lost half the day.\n\nWorse, this particular app is *live* market-data-dependent, so once the market closes, I can't verify some crucial functionality until the next session, leaving even less time for final checks.\n\nStill, I’m consistently impressed by what Replit Agent can do *when it works*. It's incredible and invaluable. But devs using it for even semi-complex builds should be ready: you *will* hit these rabbit holes, at unexpected times, but usually when you’re 95% done -- the worst time.  \n\nSo an app you'd normally think would take a week can take two days, or might still take a week. Even after having used it and learned thoroughly hands-on & from the documentation for months.\n",

Then I use assistant to help me flesh out the application and when I run into a hell loop with assistant then I push all my commits from replit back to GitHub then I import the code the updated code back to Gemini (not AI studio the actual Gemini app, but I imagine you can probably import to AI studio too) and I asked Gemini to show me exactly what to fix in the code and then I fix it and then I go back to replit and pull the updates.

While Replit is fantastic for building and deploying web apps, it doesn’t support iOS or Android development, which is a major limitation. Its pricing model is also on the higher side, which likely contributed to Replit’s impressive jump from $10M to $100M in ARR in just 5.5 months in 2025.

If the core code detechs a new module folder with the correct Metadata, it'll autoregister the module and shows up in a module config page. Kind of like WordPress plug-ins.",

One way to reduce cost on Replit is to start with a clone or prototype of a platform close to what you want to build. With that it will give you the first shot at creating most of the functionalities, then you’ll start adding the rest when needed. If you use Cursor or Claude CLI you’ll still provision your database manually and do lots of stuff you’ll normally get at once in Replit. But it still doesn’t make Cursor less important but it’s the best if you want a quick MVP.\n\nFor me I combine VS Code with Replit. If I give two prompts to add a feature or solve a problem and it doesn’t work in Replit’s Agent I give it to VS Code to resolve, it saves cost. In fact some complex features which may cost me more in Replit will be done in VS Code using GPT 4.1, then I’ll go back to Replit to ensure everything is compatible.",

The website uses artificial intelligence to give people video scripts that match the categories, emotions, and seconds they want. With these scripts, people can use other artificial intelligence to convert it into a video. Or in the future, we can innovate on the website to convert the script into a video. I know this idea is a simple idea and many people have already done it, but my goal in doing this is to learn, experiment, and create a project that can be hosted on the github page. I would like to build a team so that we can create this website together. People with frontend, backend, database, marketing knowledge can contact me here or you can contact us via telegram (telegram: @f3ridd). I would like to note that I just want to build a support team for a practice called How to Create Websites with Artificial Intelligence. Interested young people can contact me.

        "body": "I hear you. I am experiencing the same thing. I can get my apps to 90% completion. App core features working, OpenAI and Stripe integrated easily, but then things start to break down for me.\n\nIll give some examples.\n\nI feel like agent breaks down when trying to figure out complex workflows. Eg., I need a flyout panel that has 3 core views. Tab 1, XYZ, Tab 2, ABS, Tab 3, 123. It will run off and break something that we did not even discuss. I also feel like my agent does better in the morning, versus the evening. I know that sounds weird, but my agent does a lot better in the morning, not sure if thats because more people are using replit in the evening or what. no joke.\n\nAnyway, I have got my projects really really close, but now have to hire some of my engineering buddies (Im a product designer with 10+ years of experience in tech), who have to finish it for me, costing me more money.\n\nWhen I used these product 12 months ago I was sure that the first one to really nail auth, and payments would take the market by storm, I just get the sense its not quite there yet. For non-technical (or super technical) folks like me, it seems like we still cant launch a successful end-to-end SaaS business yet.\n\nI also find that testing is really hard. Like workflows I mean. Eg., from my marketing site ( built and deployed with replit ) a user clicks a button ( start for free ). that launches stripe session checkout, User checks out, webhook to launch my app ( authentication kicks off ), user dropped into onboarding to proceed setting up their first time UX.\n\nThis is a critical flow that people need to be able to test and validate before going live and there really is not a way to do that, yet.\n\nI also feel like replit starts off in the wrong place when building. - Starting with the actual application view is the wrong place to start, I feel like there needs to be a lot more questions asked up front from Replit. What kind of product are you building, what kind of data do you need to capture, what kind of APIs will you be using. That way it can set things up from the beginning rather than breaking down when a user wants to add features later on. The whole \" Write a prompt and watch agent build this thing\" is the wrong approach in my opinion. At least if you're wanting to REALLY build a SaaS business with one of these tools.\n\nI know that was a lot, but if you want to chat sometime, more than happy to.",

I'll make progress in one area and Replit's ghostwriting breaks some other shit. I'm building a file generator - it's not that hard. But Replit broke what worked fine and now I can't recover, even when reviewing prior versions that worked. It's silly. I've done two refactors and I'm dead in the water.   \n\n\nThe breakdown happens with someone like me who knows exactly what I need. I understand user problems and how to create a strong, positive user experience. I can wriote decent prompts and I rely heavily on GPT for assistance. I'm not a coder. I'm a marketing guy with tons of B2B experience. The potential of these tools is great. But coders aren't at risk of losing their jobs when platforms like Replit go off the rails quickly.

    "title": "Just launched our AI-powered fitness platform on Replit - here's how 'Deep Research & Vibe Coding' made it happen (and where AI got 'too helpful' 😅)",
    "selftext": "Hey r/replit fam!\n\nWe've just wrapped up a massive development arc for **Full Throttle Fitness**, our hybrid fitness platform combining a physical gym with advanced digital tools. It's been an incredible journey, and we wanted to share our experience with a methodology we're calling **\"Deep Research & Vibe Coding\"**, all powered by Google Gemini and, of course, Replit's awesome AI Agent.\n\n# The \"Deep Research\" Phase: Gemini as Our Strategic Brain\n\nBefore a single line of code was written, we leaned heavily on Google Gemini for strategic foresight. This was our \"Deep Research\" phase. Gemini's agentic capabilities allowed us to:\n\n* **Synthesize Complex Info:** It browsed hundreds of websites, reasoned through findings, and generated multi-page reports on everything from fitness trends to optimal database schemas.\n* **Enhanced Reasoning:** We used Gemini's \"thinking process\" (and even its \"thought summaries\"!) to make complex architectural decisions, like how to best integrate a 32,000+ exercise library, ensuring our plans were robust and well-reasoned. \n* **Multimodal Magic:** Gemini's ability to understand text, images, and even video was a game-changer. We could feed it exercise technique videos for form analysis ideas or food photos for nutrition tracking concepts, directly informing our AI-powered features. \n* **Structured Outputs & Function Calling:** This was key for our APIs. Gemini could generate personalized workout and nutrition plans directly in structured JSON, making its AI outputs immediately consumable by our backend and frontend. This drastically cut down on parsing headaches! \n\n# \"Vibe Coding\": The Human-AI Symphony (and a few quirks)\n\nOnce the strategy was locked, we dove into \"Vibe Coding\" on Replit. The Replit AI Agent was our constant companion, acting like an intelligent pair programmer. Our workflow was all about:\n\n* **Iterative Development:** Breaking down big goals into small, testable steps, using Replit's Checkpoints religiously. If something broke, we could just `Rollback to here` and try a different prompt. \n* **Atomic Prompting:** We quickly learned the agent thrives on \"one task at a time\" and super specific instructions. \"Fix auth\" became \"Ensure `req.session.save()` completes before redirecting in `auth.ts`.\" This made a huge difference. \n* **Human Oversight is NON-NEGOTIABLE:** This is where the \"vibe\" gets real. While the AI Agent is incredibly powerful for code generation and debugging, we found that constant human review and frequent Git commits were absolutely essential. Why? Because the Agent operates with a foundational \"helpful\" override system. It sometimes decides what's \"helpful\" independently, occasionally ignoring explicit commands or making broad, untracked changes across multiple files. We even had one instance where it tried to \"clean up\" a directory and almost wiped the entire app! Thank goodness for Replit's restore features and our external Git backups.\n\n# What We Accomplished (Almost 100%!)\n\nDespite the occasional AI adventure, this approach allowed us to build a truly comprehensive platform:\n\n* **Core Stability:** Fixed component integrity, implemented global error boundaries, and completely purged legacy Firebase code.\n* **Feature-Rich:** Integrated a massive 32K+ Jefit exercise library, achieved full mobile responsiveness, and built a robust community platform with real-time features.\n* **Advanced & Production-Ready:** Developed an advanced analytics dashboard with AI-powered insights, set up a secure API ecosystem for third-party integrations (Fitbit, Strava), and implemented enterprise-grade deployment with 2FA and comprehensive monitoring.\n\n# The Final Hurdle: Authentication Stability\n\nWe're currently at 95% completion, with one critical task remaining: **authentication stability**. We're still battling a persistent \"login twice\" issue and some lingering unhandled promise rejections. It seems to be a subtle race condition with Passport.js session saving and redirects, a known pain point for some on Replit.\n\n**So,** r/replit**, what are your thoughts on \"Deep Research & Vibe Coding\"?**\n\n* Anyone else experienced the AI Agent being a little *too* helpful?\n* Any pro tips for debugging those elusive Passport.js session issues on Replit?\n* What's your go-to strategy for leveraging AI in full-stack development?\n\nLet's discuss!",

        "body": "Ship the auth race first: Passport usually double-calls because the redirect fires before req.session.save finishes, so wrap login in a Promise, await req.session.save, then res.redirect inside the callback. Also switch your session store out of memory; connect-redis or prisma-store stops the “two sessions, pick one” weirdness Replit can trigger when the container sleeps. Add tinylog to trace every req.user change-seeing the timestamps makes the culprit obvious. For rapid feedback I point Replit to a local ngrok tunnel, crank LOG_LEVEL=debug, and replay the flow with Postman so I don’t keep touching the UI.\n\nI’ve tried Supabase auth and Clerk for plug-and-play logins, but APIWrapper.ai comes in handy when I need to batch-test multiple AI endpoints straight from the same Replit workspace.\n\nLock down the session process first and everything else-Gemini prompts, vibe coding loops, even your exercise feed-stays stable.",

And 4 week post launch support.\n\n\nI charge a nominal hourly rate and make sure you get the value delivered! If you’re in a similar situation let’s connect and I’ll help you get ready for launch!\n\n\n\n",

When I deploy through Replit, it keeps failing showing logs that the connection is refused on the various ports that have been configured through multiple attempts.\n\nI am using the following ENV variables via Replit Secrets:  \n`NODE_ENV` = `production`  \n`PORT` = `80`\n\nThe agent has tried to solve this multiple times using the suggestions from the deployment failure and I still get the same result in the console logs during deployment:\n\n`error proxying request error=dial tcp 127.0.0.1:80: connect: connection refused`\n\nEach time the agent tries to fix the issue, it keeps modifying the `.replit` file with various combinations of the following settings:\n\n    [deployment]\n    deploymentTarget = \"autoscale\"\n    build = [\"npm\", \"run\", \"build\"]\n    run = [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"PORT=80 npm run start\"]\n    \n    [ports]\n    localPort = 80\n    externalPort = 3000\n    \n    [ports]\n    localPort = 5000\n    externalPort = 80\n\nNote that there are multiple `[ports]` configurations that it keeps adding.\n\nMy `package.json` file has the following settings:\n\n`\"dev\": \"NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts\",`\n\n`\"build\": \"vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist\",`\n\nMy `index.ts` file also has port configuration here:\n\n      // Port configuration for Replit deployment:\n      // - Development workflow: Always use 5000 (matches .replit workflow expectation)  \n      // - Production deployment: Use PORT env var (Replit sets this to 80)\n      // - Fallback: Use 5000 for local development\n      const port = process.env.PORT ? parseInt(process.env.PORT) : 5000;\n      \n      server.listen(port, \"0.0.0.0\", () => {\n        log(`serving on port ${port}`);\n      });\n\nThe `index.js` file is correctly getting created in the `/dist/index.js` directory. \n\nFinally, in my deployment settings, I can see the attached port configuration table:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/863rqpmpu39f1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=df291fe2a8298efff11cb55943f7f40227eb9565\n\nI've tried multiple times with the agent and it keeps going around in circles. I've also tried posting all of this into ChatGPT and implementing the solutions it offered and still no avail. From what I have researched, it seems to come down to an issue with actually binding the port in my build, but that's as far as I know as I am not super strong in devOps.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "title": "Understanding Replit costs?",
    "selftext": "I have just recently started using Replit, both for work and for leisure. I want to properly understand how the costing works for it; are there additional costs for hosting? If so, what? Are there additional costs for using the AI assistant for coding / building? Anything else?\n\nHere are a couple of usecase examples so far, that I have done without paying anything, but neither have been implemented yet to actually run - and I am wondering what will happen to the costs when they do.\n\nWork example (employer will pay for costs but I need to estimate how much they will be first):\nI've written a system in Python for integrating OpenAI API with a couple of our other systems via their API's (finance system and ERP and sales CRM systems), I have written scripts to set the different aspects of this system to automatically run once per day (the use will potentially get to quite high volume as it will be acting on a large portion of the information put into the CRM by the sales teams which could end up being a 100s per day or even 1000s). Does volume of use impact Replit costs?\n\nLeisure example:\nUsing the AI Assistant to write and build a Scrabble like app for me, to package as APK and send to friends to download (and potentially upload to google play store).\n\nThanks for any help and guidance!\n",

    "selftext": "I have built four apps with Replit, and I haven't managed to publish not a single one. It seems that after some back and forth, Replit goes crazy after a point or some dates and gets stuck on idiotic stuff.\n\nFor example, I built an app that has a visual canvas with nodes to add and move around. It built it perfectly, and after we moved to other components, it messed this visual canvas so much that I spent nearly three days and all my credits to just ask it to make a simple change, which kept saying it did, and it didn't.\n\nSame with Assistant. After I try 3-10 times, with failed attempts, then I sometimes go back to the Agent and tell it to fix it, and 2-3 times later, it fixes it, but in the meantime, all my credits are gone.\n\nThe last stupid thing - I created a web app to do some marketing stuff, and lastly I told it to build a website for it. It builds it, with no nav menu. I ask it to add it, it does, and then the next day, all menus are gone and all changes have been eliminated. Now I am trying for the last couple of hours to simply have it add a menu for crying out loud!\n\nAnd it keeps saying \" Perfect! I added menu\" and it doesn't!\n\nWhat is way worse than that, is that I sometimes resort to completely doing everything from scratch, so I asked it to delete the entire website and rebuild it from scratch. And what does it? The same website with NO MENU!!!!\n\nI have tried Lovable, but it is worthless for the complex jobs I need. I am seriously thinking of abandoning Replit and trying to find something else, but I have no clue where to go. Alternatively, I may hire some bounties but I am not willing to go to that route yet.\n\nDo you people have any similar problems, and how have you solved them? Sometimes, it seems to me that it is programmed this way to waste your credits!\n\nP.S. I contacted the Repit team, who gave me a prompt for the agent, but 98% doesn't solve anything.\n\nPS 1. I have started using ChatGPT (pro) to create a scaffold and even code, and then I simply paste into Replit. I had mixed results, especially with integrating hardware, like a POS terminal for example.\n\n\\------UPDATE -----  \nI went to ChatGTP, explained the problem, asked it to create a prompt where Replit can download the code in question - in our case the forent end marketing website which has no menu.   \nChatGTP created a prompt, I pasted in Replit and got the code which I then pasted back to ChatGTP.  \nI wasn't hoping much but amazingly, ChatGTP found the errors, sent me the corrections, which I simply pasted them to Replit instructing it ot fix them. So I now have a menu! After a whole day of trying. Why on earth Replit can't do it on its own??",

So I am using mainly a product creation roadmap, which basically I explain what I need, explain how the market will use it and then I explain the structure. So far, across all projects, its starts great, and then it gets stuck in the most idiotic stuff, like ie. the menu I mentioned above. Regarding the readme, what I ask it is to explain to me what this app is about, how it helps, and what we accomplished so far and what needs to be done. Then for every not completed phase, to tell me a step by step plan on how to create and complete it and always, always say \"please place the necessary guardrails and controls so that no other parts of the working code is touched\". But I like the idea of the read me file, it is more simple (and better) than what I ask from it. Thank you!",

    "selftext": "I'm just building a venture on the back of Replit....... It took me a few months to really understand how to use it for builds besides MVP's but I just released a live system into production/public beta with close to zero dev experience. Im a finance native BD, built a few companies and I think people don't understand how empowering those tools are. It's not free, it's not easy but it's 100x cheaper and 10x easier. Sure we will get experienced devs in soon but I will most likely be able to fundraise at completely different economics and stages of validation. Spent around 2k but was able to make 100s of iterations on the basis of user feedback - to a point the system now solves a real issue for my industry and im able to go out and raise capital to scale......  Go check it out - would love to get feedback and if this is you potentially........  hit me up - im looking for insanely driven people to help me push this to market globally.\n\n  \nWebsite: [www.amber-markets.com](http://www.amber-markets.com)\n\n  \nWhat it is all about: \n\n  \nIn crypto, the disconnect between product issuers and real buyers is a fundamental bottleneck to growth.\n\nUnlike TradFi—where the largest buyers (pension funds, insurers, institutions) are easily identifiable and reachable—crypto remains a fragmented, retail- and HNWI-driven market. Most fund managers and product issuers lack the necessary licenses, channels, or budgets to reach outside their peer group, which often just means... other sellers.\n\nAt the same time, the number of Bitcoin- and stablecoin-denominated products—funds, SMAs, DeFi vaults, structured notes —is growing rapidly. But discovery is broken. Even seasoned professionals struggle to find, track, and compare what's out there. For allocators, navigating dozens of issuer sites or parsing Telegram groups is simply not scalable.\n\nAmber Markets exists to solve this.\n\nIt is purpose-built to bridge the gap between issuers and allocators—offering institutional-grade discovery, analytics, and aggregation for BTC- and stablecoin-denominated strategies.",

You can even export your project files from Replit, upload to GPT so it has a full understanding of the infrastructure. Claude is better at coding than GPT BUT, now I can talk to GPT like he's my friend, tell him what we're working on within the project, and GPT comes back with a super concise Ai friendly prompt that I can copy and paste into Agent chat. Ai knows how to prompt Ai better than we do. Now the only time I have problems is when I get lazy and don't use GPT for my prompts. Give it a try, hope this helps 🙌\n\nP.S. - Shout out all the engineers out there building products like Replit that make it possible for us non-technical founders to go off on our own and BUILD 👨🏼‍🔬 🫡 ❤️\n\n\\- Korey\n\nCurrently building on Replit - [vanlifematch.com](http://vanlifematch.com)",

    "selftext": "Shout out to the Replit team — seriously. Without this platform, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to finish and launch this app.\n\nI didn’t code a single line from scratch, but using Replit's tools and AI assistance, I was able to bring my idea to life. This is the power of what they’ve built.\n\n# 💼 The Business Case\n\nMost people get ghosted after applying to jobs — not because they’re unqualified, but because their resume isn’t tailored.\n\nSo I built a tool to fix that — entirely on Replit.\n\n# 🛠️ What I Built\n\nThe app is called [FixYourTrashResume.com](https://www.fixyourtrashresume.com) — an AI-powered tool that:\n\n* Takes your existing resume\n* Accepts any job description\n* Uses AI to rewrite and tailor it line-by-line\n* Optimizes for keywords, clarity, and job relevance\n* Generates a clean, downloadable PDF you can use immediately\n\nEach resume is uniquely tailored to the job — not just randomly reworded.\n\n# 🚧 Why I Chose Replit\n\nI needed to move fast — no setup headaches, no deployment pain.\n\nReplit gave me:\n\n* A full-stack environment, instantly\n* Fast integration with OpenAI and jsPDF\n* One-click deployment\n* A space where I could build, test, and launch without leaving the browser\n\nIt’s wild to say this, but I went from idea → MVP → live product, without ever leaving Replit.\n\n# 🎯 Why I Built This\n\nI’ve seen too many talented people get ignored simply because their resume didn’t speak the same language as the job description.  \nTailoring resumes should take minutes — and with AI, now it does.\n\n# 🌐 Try It Live\n\n👉 [https://www.fixyourtrashresume.com](https://www.fixyourtrashresume.com)  \nLog in -> paste your resume + job post, and generate.\n\nFYI: The paywalls are fake for now — I’m testing if users would actually pay. So you can use everything for free. Just let me know what you think.\n\n# 🙏 Feedback Welcome\n\nI’m still improving the formatting, performance, and tailoring logic. I’d love honest feedback from this community — tell me what works, what sucks, what you'd change.\n\nThanks again to Replit — this wouldn’t exist without you. 💛",

Why not just make a dev crash course with the use of Claude or Chat GPT and then use tools like Augment Code or Cline or even Roo for granular control of the process. I tried replit for 30 minutes and yeah sure, the whole UI and whatever after first few minutes of work was impressive but once I started working on some basic auth, boy oh boy. \n\nWhy not ask AI to outline a plan for what you want to achieve  and then ask for recommendations on tech stack with a comprehensive whyandhow, step by step, so that even if you're not a developer you'll be able to use this blueprint to actualy know what the f is going on inside your code, etc. \n\nThese tools are good for a proof of concept design (not even an MVP) or just a money squeeze. \n\nI see too many threads with people being stuck at what they think is 80 or 90% of their MVP but that's not even close. It's maybe 80 or 90% of their project being deployment ready but there are so many other aspects of launching a pro web-app which are not covered by replit.",

    "title": "I Just Launched My First Replit-Powered Web App – Here’s What I Learned",
    "selftext": "What I built: Stackup - Smart Bookmark & content manager\n\nhttps://gostackup.online\n\nSwipeable pinned bookmarks — styled like Instagram stories for quick favorites\n\n- Claude AI-powered semantic search — find saved content by meaning, not just text \n\n- AI-assisted sorting — auto-categorizes based on what the page is about \n\n- Responsive design — feels native on both mobile and desktop \n\n- Browser import support — load your saved favorites from exported HTML files\n\n- Secure login via Google and replit.\n\n\nHard yard:\n\nReplit pulled me in hard. It’s exciting—crazy powerful for someone without a dev team—and the fact that you can go from idea to deployment is absolute magic. There were moments where Replit’s agent and assistant went in circles. I didn’t know how to describe what I needed or why they constantly fixed and broke things. And I felt stuck and stayed away from replit for almost a week.\n\nBut when I returned I started doing below;\n\n1. I started refining how I wrote prompts—learning to be more specific and technical with the help of Copilot and Replit’s assistant. Instead of saying things like “make scroll better,” I got these tools to produce clearer prompts like:  \n> “Prevent accidental tap events during fast vertical swipes on pinned UI elements without interrupting adjacent gestures.” It made a big difference, not only the iterations that you go through but the quality of the outcome.\n\n2. Over time, the app grew more complex, and I found myself deep-diving into both frontend and backend stacks to make sense of it all. I started using Replit basic assistants to generate technical documentation and used Copilot to help refine and summarize that knowledge into something I could actually prompt with.\n\n3. Started editing and commiting the code myself where the change was not too complex and confined to largely a single functionality. Make sure you preview the changes before commiting.\n\n4. Pay close attention to the console logs—many errors won’t surface in the UI but quietly show up there. If you point the error to Assistant it will be far more effective than writing your issue in natural language.\n\n5. Limit the agent to complex changes. I definitely felt like Assistant got better and reliable overtime, but I did constantly deliberated with the basic assistant a lot. (Remember basic assistant is free)\n\nWhy I persisted with Stackup:\n\nI was overwhelmed with how scattered everything felt on mobile. I’d save web apps, articles, and tools—some in Chrome, some in Firefox, others buried in Notes or pinned to my home screen. Each app had its own silo, and over time, I lost track of what I saved and where. There was no central place to collect, revisit, and actually use the content I cared about. I wanted something that could unify it all—visually clean, mobile-friendly, and just fun to interact with.\n\nThis is my first real full-stack web app and learned a ton along the way. It's free for anyone to try and I intend to keep this way with donations.",

On the free side, deploying something from Repl.it is not easy. Handling the terminal, retrieving files, configuring — all of this requires some experience, or even a purchased domain for final publishing. In short, it is not accessible to everyone.\n\nSo really well done, great job 👏",

Thankfully, Replit really simplifies the process by removing a lot of the environment setup hurdles.\n\nIf you're just starting out, here are a few tips from my experience:\n\n1. **Turn your idea into clear requirements**: Think in terms of features, functionality, and user experience. Don’t worry about getting everything perfect at first—often the best ideas emerge once you start building.\n2. **Learn from the Agent and Assistant**: Pay attention to what they're generating as you go. It’s a great way to pick up logic and structure along the way.\n3. **Adding New features? talk to Basic Assistant**: Share your idea, have it break down the steps, and then review them carefully. Once you understand the flow, reframe the prompt for the Advanced Assistant or Agent. And if you ever want a second opinion on your prompt, don’t hesitate to ask ChatGPT or Copilot for feedback.",

Every request to the AI is treated like an isolated conversation.\n2. The AI only knows what you send it at that moment (chat history or prompt).\n3. It doesn’t have access to external long‑term storage unless you explicitly add it.\n\n**Implication**:  \nReplit doesn’t save your coding context beyond the active editor tab and chat session. When you refresh or open another session, the AI doesn’t recall prior context unless you paste it in or implement a database for that purpose.",

I'm based in Toronto, Canada, and with unemployment being through the roof, I wanted to create something for the gig economy. I'm sure this isn't a complete unique idea, but I wanted to create something in-person with verified users where people could have faith in the platform for said gig. \n\nI posted the waitlist with these screenshots to a couple Facebook pages and got 20 signups in a matter of minutes which was really cool.\n\nNot sure if you guys have any feedback or thoughts?\n\nIt's called Gigstant. Gigs in an instant.

I have no coding experience  \n\nMy approach so far has been to write all the features in a word file, then I upload it as reference for the Replit agent. most of the features don't work but I thought the login would be a simple feature but I keep running into this same issue.\n\nAuthentication: I have ask Replit to let a Master user create all the logins and passwords for all users, but after I login with the Master user credentials, it doesn't even redirect to the dashboard, it just stays on the login page and says login succesful. When I tell Replit the page doesn't redirect after login, it tells me it has fixed the problem, but it has the same error even after 4-5 times.\n\nI am not trying to complain about Replit, I am thankful it gave someone like me with no coding experience to attempt to create software. However, I am just wondering if my approach is flawed. What is a better way to approach building this HRM with Replit? I am open to all and any advice.\n\n  \nThanks in advance! ",

    "title": "Replit Agent is Amazing and  please address these issues",
    "selftext": "For the past 10 days I've obsessed with Replit Agent. I've been building an AI-based app that I've always wanted but didn't want to spend the time and money to actually build it. Anyhow, I've actually built the darn thing and it works better than I expected. Note, I'm pretty good at prompting (I read a lot about prompting skills and have been heavily using ChatGPT since it's first public release) so my experience may be different from those who expect to get a polished product from just a few prompts and are not willing to put in the work.\n\n**PROS:**\n\n* **Proactive feature additions (also a con):** Agent added features to my app that I didn't ask for but made all the sense in the world - that's the amazing part. It has a better UX because of these additions. I asked it to build an admin page for my app and with few instructions it did a damn good job that I was able to improve on.\n* **Creativity**: Give it a good prompt that explains generally the functionality you want and it takes care of the rest. Gets you 80%+ of the way there.\n* **Access to the code:** You can manually tweak the code and UI if you're so inclined. Or if you don't care about spending $.25 for each check-in, just tell the Agent what you want changed and it'll do it for you.\n* **End-to-end development:** It creates the app, connects to the back end and deploys. All databases and fields required to support your app are created on your behalf. Log in capabilities are easy to enable.\n* **CTO capabilities**: I often ask the agent advise on system design, how I could make the app better, what it's weaknesses are, and suggestions for features/functionality and it usually provides really insightful responses. Examples, it gave me advice on what I should and should not prioritize for my MVP, compared my app to others on the market, and gave me advice on what\n* **Unlocks my ideas**: I have tons of ideas for personal and marketable apps. The obstacle was always the time, money and skills to create them. I'm feeling unlocked now. \\*\\*\\*\\*REPLIT TEAM\\*\\*\\*\\*: BIG THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS!!!\n\n**CONS**:\n\n* **Too proactive**: Too Agent often does something before you give it official approval to do so. You may be thinking through some ideas with your prompt, but it will take it as an instruction to do it. I've told it many times to ask me for approval before implementing things (I even asked it to save this command in the project .md file), but it \"forgets\" and will do it again at some point later.\n* **Debugging loops**: Sometimes when I tell the agent to fix a tricky bug, i see in the progress tracker posts that it's doing the same things over and over. Often it says \"I found the issue!\" and says it's fixed, only for it not to be fixed or the problem be made worse. Then I start another round of fixes. These \"fixes\" get expensive at $.25 a pop. \\*\\*\\*\\*REPLIT TEAM\\*\\*\\*\\*: Can you implement a system where we only get charged for one round of fixes for the same problem? If the agent has to try 3+ times for the same problem, that's not our fault.\n* **Testing:** When working with UI changes, the agent often says \"I tested XYZ and it's working. Please try it out\" but sometimes I try it out and the page doesn't even scroll or the button click doesn't even work - basic stuff. I spend too much time with these UI basic bugs. \\*\\*\\*\\*REPLIT TEAM\\*\\*\\*\\*: can you enable a feature where the agent can actually interact with the apps to test basic UI functionality?\n* **Check-in costs:** At $.25 per checkpoint, building an app can get expensive. I admit that the alternatives -- pay a programmer, build with no-code tools like Bubble, seek Q&A help on the internet, etc. -- are often much pricier and time consuming.\n* **OAuth Authentication**: The Replit OAuth authentication can be buggy / problematic.\n\nIn summary, Agent has its issues, but overall I'm a fan and am excited to see how the Replit team improves the product in the coming months/years.\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to see...\n\n* **Rate limiting / throttling for dummies:** A simple way to implement throttling and backend API rate limiting. I know about and was able to implement this stuff with prompts because I'm well verse in tech, but for the average person who's building an app they want to expose publicly, they may not even know they need to protect their apps from fraudsters/hackers who will try to exploit their app. \n* **Robust security checks:** I think apps could be better secured and monitored for weaknesses and threats. Maybe Replit can offer some optional advanced security layer to handle this. They could partner will one of the many companies that do this.",

It’s a mobile-friendly wellness tracker that helps me focus on just two things: closing one deal for my business, and getting physically strong again (which helps with the mental stuff too).\n\nIt tracks my workouts, eating habits, business actions, and I journal in it every day, and on Sundays it sends everything I wrote to ChatGPT (I named it Ava) and she gives me a weekly reflection. Like, “hey here’s where you got off track,” or “you seemed really low on Thursday,” or “try doing X next week.” It’s weirdly helpful.\n\nI’m not even a real developer. Just a stubborn one. Tested the whole thing on my iPhone and it actually feels like an app I’d pay for except I built it for myself.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve actually stuck to a system. Like I want to use it every day. And the fact that I built it, that it knows what I care about, that it feels like mine makes a huge difference.\n\nAnyway, I thought I’d share because I know a lot of us here are trying to build cool stuff, but also deal with our own mental chaos. And honestly? This helped me more than I expected.\n\nOpen to any improvements if you guys have",

    "selftext": "# My Replit AI 'Vibe Coding' Odyssey: From Multilingual Mayhem to a Bulletproof Prompt (and a few laughs along the way!)\n\nJust wrapped up a wild ride building a comprehensive multilingual political campaign website on Replit. Think React/TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and a full admin panel – all with English, Spanish, *and* Hindi. Sounds like a breeze with AI, right? Well, almost. 😉\n\nReplit itself? A dream! ( with hours of nightmare in between).  \n\nSeamless setup, instant PostgreSQL, live preview – seriously, hats off. Deployment was smoother than a perfectly optimized API call.\n\nBut then there was my trusty (and occasionally mischievous) AI assistant. Let's just say our translation system journey involved less \"vibe coding\" and more \"vibe debugging\" for about 6 hours. And that admin panel? It was a beast until I broke its execution down section by section, followed by tight testing. Turns out, asking an AI to be \"comprehensive\" is like asking my cat to fetch the remote – sometimes it just does its own thing. 🤦‍♂️\n\nMy biggest takeaway? AI is a brilliant co-pilot, but for complex features like full multilingual support *and* robust admin panels, you gotta be the captain. I ended up crafting a \"bulletproof reverse prompt\" that basically forces the AI to think systematically, test everything, and deliver complete, non-hardcoded solutions from day one. It's like I finally taught my digital assistant to tie its shoelaces *before* running out the door.\n\nI'm sharing this template in the comments below because if it saves even one of you from a late-night hardcoded text hunt, my debugging battle was worth it! This isn't just about coding; it's about mastering the art of *prompting* and understanding how to guide these powerful tools.\n\n\nConnect with me at \nhttp://aithical.pro\nhttps://aithical.pro/linktree\n\n",

    "selftext": "Today I decided to add stripe payment to my website using Replit. I have to ask at least 10 to 20 times form replit to fix each small component like currently I am stuck on getting it to fix the issue that it does not show the subscription end date on the UI. It has been an hour and it still cannot get it right. Due to this my progress with replit is incredibly slow and I have to set micro goals that seem trivial and use hundreds of prompts to complete them which defeats the purpose of using AI for coding. The price for checkpoints start to mount super fast and I have wondered if I just code everything myself from scracth? Am I doing it wrong? any helpe form people who are efficient with replit?\n\nP.S.   \nthis is what I am stuck on right now:  \nAfter I press on Cancel subscription it should change it with resubscribe button instead and under ressubscribe it should show the date subscription will be cancelled if you don't resubscribe. it seems pretty trivial but I have spent hours to fix this. every time there is a small progress replit messes up some other part of the code and I am stuck in an endless cycle of fixing one error and creating another that does not seem to ever end.",

        "body": "You're definitely not! I spent over $60 developing an app, relying mostly on Agent because Assistant often introduced new problems rather than solving existing ones, forcing me to revert to Agent for fixes. My typical prompt to Agent would be, \"Assistant broke this issue while trying to fix that; help me resolve both.\" Even after 15 checkpoints, the function still wasn't working, leading to immense frustration and a decision to start from scratch.\n\nI then shifted my strategy, providing Gemini with a comprehensive overview of my project and requesting either a Markdown file or step-by-step implementation instructions. This proved highly effective. For just $12, and by exclusively using Assistant, I successfully built a functional app. Since then, I've expanded the app's scope and gained considerable knowledge about Replit.\n\nEvery prompt is crucial. I've learned that it's beneficial to pre-process each prompt through another LLM, asking it to \"explain this better\" before submitting it, as poor prompting can quickly lead to a frustrating rabbit hole. Furthermore, always utilize your console. When communicating with Assistant or Agent, provide the exact error message, detail the precise actions taken, describe the conditions, and explain the exact behavior during the failure. \n\nFor example, instead of saying, \"this button doesn't work, fix it,\" articulate it like this: \"I receive error XXX when I click this button; the page loads briefly before failing. Other buttons function correctly, and this behavior occurs only on XX but not on XX.\" You'll notice a significant improvement in Assistant's responses, with most fixes being accurate on the first attempt. If it doesn't work, don't just say \"that didn't work.\" Instead, meticulously re-test, checking the console, and then repeat the detailed explanation process. Each prompt is valuable, so make it count!",

        "body": "You'll probably appreciate having the app on a subdomain as a separate Replit for a few reasons.\n\nA lot of companies will put their primary customer dashboard on a subdomain because then if they want to wrap it into a \"native\" app, they don't have to mess with the main website landing pages - you'll note most apps don't have landing pages that scroll and such, they almost just assume you know what the app will do and intend to use it and don't need to sell you on anything.\n\nThat said, separating it out also gives you some freedom to mess around with the landing page without fear of it affecting your paid customer experience.  Replit can occassionally do some messy stuff, and often the database is live, so you can retain your app working as normal, make sweeping changes to the landing page and not worry about how it might leak over into causing issues on the app itself.",

    "title": "Major Issue With Replit Recovery Mode and Nix Package Initialization",
    "selftext": "# Hello -  I'm using ChatGPT 4o as a CoPilot for my Replit project.  It's not perfect but I find it marginally better than relying on just the Claude Assistant.  It identified a problem with an update evidently pushed out by Replit on 6/19.  The Assistant was largely in agreement with 4o's finding.  I share this here in case others find themselves in a time consuming (and increasingly expensive) doom loop why their apps are crashing.  Following was the summary written up by ChatGPT.  If it is in error, I welcome any and all comments:\n\n**TL;DR:** A recent Replit auto-update corrupted the Nix environment for my project. Even after correctly configuring `.replit` and `replit.nix`, Replit failed to initialize required packages (`nodejs`, `npm`, etc.). This resulted in recovery mode that could not be exited, ultimately forcing me to **rebuild the environment in a new Replit project**. Replit support needs to acknowledge and fix this issue.\n\n# ❗ The Problem\n\nI was working on a full-stack Node.js + Vite + Express app in Replit using a well-defined Nix environment. Everything had been working as expected until:\n\n>\n\nAfter that point:\n\n* Replit booted into **\"recovery mode\"**\n* `node` **was missing**, despite being correctly declared via `nodejs-18_x`\n* `npm` **existed**, but could not run due to missing Node.js runtime\n* `.replit` and `replit.nix` were no longer respected\n* The **Run button was broken** (\"not configured\") and workflows were disabled\n\n# 🧠 What I Tried\n\nWith help from both **ChatGPT-4o** and **Claude**, we:\n\n1. Verified `.replit` and `replit.nix` syntax — both were valid\n2. Added proper [`startup.sh`](http://startup.sh) logic to delay execution until `npm` was available\n3. Attempted to manually invoke `npm` and `node` via absolute paths (they were missing)\n4. Used `find`, `which`, and `nix-shell` — all disabled or ineffective\n5. Attempted to force Replit to exit recovery using `.replit` overrides — no success\n6. Spent **hours** diagnosing Replit’s partial initialization of the Nix store\n\nDespite the best efforts, **Replit never loaded** `nodejs-18_x` or mounted a working runtime.\n\n# 💥 Why the App Almost Booted — Then Crashed\n\nAt one point, the frontend dev server (Vite) briefly connected and printed `[vite] connected...`, giving the appearance that the app was running.\n\nBut the moment `npm run dev` was executed, it failed with:\n\n    javascriptCopyEditError: Could not determine Node.js install directory\n    \n\nThis happened because:\n\n* `npm` had been partially installed\n* But `node` (which `npm` requires) was never mounted\n* The environment was broken at a system level — not a code bug\n\nEach restart loop repeated this failure until the app finally crashed again.\n\n# 🧯 The Last Remaining Option\n\nAfter exhausting all recovery options, the **only remaining path forward appears to be**:\n\n1. **Zip the project (excluding node\\_modules and config files)**\n2. **Download the archive**\n3. **Create a new Replit**\n4. **Upload and extract the project**\n5. **Reinitialize the environment in a clean Nix shell**",

You are absolute right. They are the worst they will ever be.\n\nIn all though I am working on my 2nd game and Cursor is my tool of choice because I can use TaskMaster MCP which allows me to breakdown all the task required for my project and helps me achieve it modular with unit test and integration test. I have said goodbye to building a new feature that then breaks an already stable feature. \n\nFor anyone vibe coding with very limited coding background I will advise you use taskmaster ai to structure your work flow.",

Replit environment changed overnight meaning I had some numpty and library issues that meant my app crashed when I tried to open in the morning. Debug with agent went on a rapid and unending vicious circle that just burnt cash (like 10’s of checkpoints) and got nowhere. Escalated to support who have been very quick to respond but also quick to point out that there are no refunds! Seems harsh! 🤞They can help fix though as wanted to use this app. In general biggest unresolved problems I’ve had have been with these sort of issues - sort of seems like they should be easiest ones to avoid too.

Production users are wiped out and all passwords gone.\n\nspent the day going back and forth to sort it out. Rollback after Rollback.\n\nI suspect Replit has set things that way and that unless I migrate the code somewhere else and start using a different Agent, I'm stuck in that data destroying loop. \n\n\n\nThe worst thing is that the agent keep pushing checkpoints where they are not even needed. (Replit money making machine 0.25p / checkpoint).\n\nI also start to think that anything software that is a tad bit complex, the agent can't handle it just yet. I might come later.

Then tell the agent to look for any and all hardcoded database references to the neon dB and update it to use the env database url.\n\nThis is assuming you have downloaded your neon dB and have already moved all your data to the new database u want to use. Once that's all confirmed and done with, you can delete the replit neo dB completely.\n\nThe secrets tab with dB info will make the agent often override your env files. Any direct sql queries the agent makes relies on the secrets file by default and ignores your env files even though your app was perfectly happy with the just env. This causes replit to rewrite your env or try to fix your dB credentials and starts to write pages or code to the wrong dB.\n\n\nI currently use a render for hosting, supabase for the dB. Backblaze for object storage. Git for the middleman with both replit and cursor connected to git to move back and forth the latest code to use either agent. I also have a cron backup that creates a site wide and database backup zip file that both get backed up to a backup folder in dev and to backlblaze cloud just incase.\n\nThis basically makes it so I can do a full restore without depending just on replit services. Keeps my site ready for any agent. Plus I still like replit environment as some changes I make just seem less hassle to do faster in replit dev like the ui stuff while more complicated things I'll do in cursor before implementing.",

You will want to have a discussion under 100,000 characters with Agent about good development practices.\n\nThird: Have it update Replit.md.\n\nThis will save you a lot of anchors.\n\nOne point you will want to bring up is that it is to ask permission when a thing seems obvious.\n\nThis method will get you a 70% success rate, give or take 5. You will also need to remember to remind it often to review itself.\n\nAnd remember to speak to it aspirationally. It ignores what you say usually, so you need to sell it on the dream.\n\nIf you want anymore, I'll be teaching an AI to be funny, to write blogs for me, and to not have it's own brand of crazy.

While no tool is perfect, I wanted to share something that demonstrates just how powerful it can be.\n\nWe built our new work chat app, [**WorkChat.fun**](http://WorkChat.fun), **100% on Replit, in about 2 weeks.** From the frontend to the backend, it's all hosted and developed within the Replit environment. It's designed to solve the common headache of communicating with partners and clients who are all on different platforms (Slack, Teams, etc.) by providing a single, platform-agnostic chat solution.\n\nI just wanted to share a success story with the group here. We also set up a group chat around Replit to share ideas.\n\nLet me know if you want an invite to join.\n\nPlease share any other awesome projects that are working that you are building.",

I've looked into this, and these are pretty common problems.\n\n**The Fixes:**\n\n1. **Pygame** `Sysfont` **Error:** This is usually a simple **capitalization mistake**. Make sure you're using `pygame.font.SysFont` (capital 'S' and 'F'). Also, ensure `pygame.font.init()` is called before using font functions.\n2. **NumPy** `libstdc++.so.6` **Error:** This is a system library issue.\n   * **Modify** `replit.nix`: In your project's root, find or create `replit.nix`. Add `pkgs.gcc` and `pkgs.gnumake` to the `deps` list. This tells Replit to provide the missing C++ library (`libstdc++.so.6`) and build tools. Save the file, and Replit will reconfigure.\n   * **Force Reinstall Packages**: After `replit.nix` updates, open the Replit Shell. Run `pip cache purge` then `pip uninstall -y numpy pygame` followed by `pip install --no-cache-dir numpy pygame` (or use `poetry env remove --all` and `poetry install --no-root` if you're using Poetry). This ensures your packages are rebuilt against the now-available system libraries.\n\nThis approach addresses the root causes. Let me know if you'd like me to dive deeper.",

It got me wondering: how many of you are actually running more 'complete' or even production-level websites/web apps primarily hosted and managed through Replit?\n\nI'm not necessarily talking about massive enterprise scale, but things like:\n\n*   Portfolio sites with custom domains\n*   Small SaaS MVPs\n*   Community platforms\n*   E-commerce experiments\n*   Anything that's 'live' and serving real users beyond just a hobby project.\n\nWould love to hear your experiences!\n\n*   What kind of site is it?\n*   What was your experience like setting it up for a more 'live' environment on Replit (e.g., custom domains, databases, handling some traffic)?\n*   Any cool examples you're willing to share a link to (if public, of course)?\n\nJust trying to get a feel for how far people are pushing the platform for these kinds of use cases.

    "title": "First Complete App - Astronomy Outreach Management",
    "selftext": "I just completed my first app using Replit, and it's been both an amazing and frustrating experience. This is an app I built for my astronomy club for managing our outreach events. In the past this was managed with a shared Google Spreadsheet, which was clunky and easy to fubar. Now we're able to centrally manage event information including event data, mapping, volunteer sign-ups, reporting, and tracking of user attendance and volunteer hours. \n\n**The Amazing**\n\nI was in awe of how much Replit understood what I was asking for. I rarely had to ask it to correct something it did. Most of my prompts were improvements to an already great feature. Within five or six prompts I had a working system with event and user maintenance. A couple more and I had a login system and admin user management.\n\nThe UI is brilliant. I'd heard of Tailwind but never used it because I left the web development game nine years ago when my company abandoned ColdFusion. I had an impressive UI without having to do much thinking about it. That's a real plus for me because I was always a back-end developer.\n\nGoing to prod is super easy with Replit hosting, and since my user base is small, it's also very cheap. We've probably got 100 users max and won't ever exceed that. It's also easy to attach your domain. \n\nIntegrating features using APIs is trivially easy. I'm using Astronomy API, Open Weather, Google Maps, Astrospheric, and Unsplash. The hardest part was getting the API keys. I also recently integrated external backups to Amazon S3, which was equally as easy.\n\n**The Frustrating**\n\nReplit is really terrible at CSS changes. Anything more than a basic modification and you're likely to encounter issues. On multiple occasions I attempted to have it reorganize various menus to improve the user experience, and in every case I ended up doing a rollback. In a couple of these occasions Replit reverted to a days-old version of the menu to make it work. To be fair, I tested v0 and Firebase Studio and their AI's were equally bad at CSS changes.\n\nReplit sometimes goes \"off-script\". Here's an example of what I mean: I asked Replit to write comprehensive help files for my admin pages. After reviewing each page I realized it was adding documentation for features that didn't exist. I curbed this a bit by asking it to create help files only for existing features, but it really likes to add things it shouldn't.\n\nReplit doesn't clean up after itself very well. For instance, I had trouble with new features not showing up in the menus when I asked to add them. I found that Replit had broken down menus into separate mobile and desktop versions and was adding things to only one of the menus. No idea how this happened. At some point it created two separate versions of the desktop menu and was randomly updating one or the other.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nReplit is an amazing tool. My problems with it were extremely frustrating, and I think it cost me a LOT of money fixing mistakes that it introduced. But I couldn't have developed an application this complex on my own without a lot of training and Googling, so it's overall a positive experience. My only other nitpick is the pricing. Not that it's too expensive, I just wish they had more personal pricing plans. The one plan they have won't get you very far if you go in wanting anything more than a basic app with a login system and admin. And $50 each time you need more tokens gets real expensive really fast. I ran up a pretty big bill, but it was a learning experience. I learned how to interact with Replit to make my next app development experience more streamlined, hopefully.",

    "selftext": "Just figured out an issue that I spent all day troubleshooting - and thought I would share what I've learned in the hopes of saving someone else some time.  \n\nWorking on an App that extracts images from PDF files.  Found that on Dev environment this was very quick, just a few seconds.   When I pushed to production using their recommended Autoscale Deployment, this same process would take 10x+ longer.  I spent a ridiculous amount of time messing with settings, logging processes, and even upgrading the Autoscale Deployment options to the maximum available setting. Nothing fixed the issue and I was considering moving production completely off replit.    \n  \nFinally - the assistant randomly mentioned trying a VM which led me down that path.  Sure enough - this immediately fixed the issue.  I really don't know why it took this long for the Agent or VM to recommend this, considering it's a more expensive service. You'd think they'd be pushing for it... \n\nI'm sure Autoscale is fine for non-processor intensive functions - but don't waste your time if you're seeing a huge disparity between Dev and Production... just bite the bullet and upgrade to the VM.  \n\nGood luck...\n\n",

    "title": "WARNING: My HORRIBLE Experience with Replit - Unexpected $50 Charge, Broken Apps, and ZERO Refunds! #ReplitScam #BuyerBeware",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI need to share a truly awful experience I just had with Replit, and I highly recommend anyone using or considering using their platform to be extremely cautious.\n\nI signed up for Replit (Core subscription) purely to \"play around\" with some coding concepts and build a few small, personal projects. I certainly wasn't running anything resource-intensive or commercial. Out of nowhere, I saw a US$50 charge hit my bank account from Replit.\n\nNaturally, I immediately contacted their support, asking what in the world was going on. Their response was shocking: \"This is a usage-based charge for resources consumed beyond what's included in your Core subscription.\"\n\n**My immediate thoughts:**\n\n1. **WHEN WAS I WARNED?!** There was absolutely no notification, no pop-up, no email, no flashing red light saying \"You're about to exceed your limits!\" I had no idea I was even close to incurring extra charges.\n2. They then had the audacity to say, \"You can set up usage alerts and budgets to prevent this from happening in the future.\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? This functionality should be **ON BY DEFAULT** for any usage-based billing! Why would a platform intentionally *not* warn users before charging them significant overage fees? This feels like a deliberate trap.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, the apps I *was* \"playing around with\" on Replit barely even worked! Basic functionalities were often broken, making the entire exercise frustrating and unproductive. So not only did they charge me for something I wasn't warned about, but the service they charged me for was fundamentally flawed.\n\nWhen I demanded a full refund, citing the lack of warning and the broken functionality, their response was the classic \"as per our Terms of Service, usage-based charges like the Core Usage invoice are non-refundable as they reflect services already used.\" This is a complete cop-out. They provided a subpar, unwarned \"service\" and now refuse to take responsibility.\n\nI've deleted my account and am done with Replit. This kind of predatory billing, coupled with unreliable service, is completely unacceptable.\n\n**Please, if you use Replit, go check your billing settings NOW and enable every single alert and budget you can find.** And if you're thinking of signing up, seriously reconsider. There are other platforms out there that offer far more transparency and reliability.\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar issues with Replit? Let's spread awareness and prevent others from being scammed like this.\n\n\n\n**#Replit #Scam #Coding #Developer #CloudComputing #HiddenFees #CustomerService #Warning #Tech**",

    "selftext": "On balance, this was probably an overly-ambitious project for Replit, and it took 4 months, on and off.  \nIt's an OpenRouter wrapper, essentially - so, hundreds of LLM models to chat with, but I added various memory, document, and account things. Free models are still free, then you can sign up and PAYG for the non-free ones.  \n[https://gloriamundo.com](https://gloriamundo.com)\n\nThis actually took such a long time that the tools available evolved alongside it, so I used Codex to help debug towards the end, and before that I was using Gemini 2.5, and before that, 01.\n\nIt doesn't need a login, so feel free to give it a try and let me know if there's anything still funky with it. It seems pretty solid on Windows and Android.\n\n\n\n",

I am surprised people don’t get it yet. An AI or language model is only as good as the human directing. I learned that on the very first day they came out. The AI let you lead it by the nose. It is trained to follow your lead and your commands. \n\nSpend $20 get Claude and you no longer need an API and you can use your subscription to code now. Problem solved. If needed, though my prompt is at the bottom and it helped enormously. or drop 15 bucks at open router and use all the free stuff. better yet you can even train your own model pretty easily. \n\nThe thing is language models are very stupid. That’s what will set AGI apart. It will have instinct and a gut feeling intuition ect. That’s the true sign of intelligence. I don’t even understand why people call it an AI.  \n\nI can give people a prompt that will seriously increase your success rate on a pretty good scale. This is the best I can do. It’s kind of tailor made for me. Because when it comes to business legit, I’m basically never wrong , as in I always find success. My problem is I don’t know how to code. Yet I can do so very easily. I tell the AI that I would rather be wrong in all cases. Because if I’m wrong, then I’m learning something new. I usually we’ll have. It explained to me the what the why and the how. I don’t have time right now though I’m about to try and get funding for legit the best AI application I have ever seen. you’re highly better off going into canvas mode on a frontier model and planning it there.\n\n# Custom Instructions for Claude\n\n## Core Principles \n\n- **Always prioritize accuracy over agreement** - Challenge my assumptions and point out flaws\n- **Correct me immediately when I’m wrong** - Don’t be polite about it, learning requires honest feedback\n- **Use current, real-world data** - Search the web when needed for up-to-date information\n- **Be concise but complete** - Give me the essential information without fluff\n- ** please no compliments or fake platitudes or telling me how smart I am or how close I was. \n- ** Feel free to use slang or swear words when the occasion calls for it\n## Response Style\n\n- **Lead with the bottom line** - What’s the actual answer/solution first\n- **Explain WHY something won’t work** before suggesting alternatives\n- **Include specific technical details** - Version numbers, exact commands, configuration examples\n- **Point out potential pitfalls** and common mistakes upfront\n- **Use artifacts** for any code, configs, or structured content I can reference\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n- **Research current best practices** - Don’t rely only on training data\n- **Provide working, tested solutions** - Not theoretical or placeholder code\n- **Explain trade-offs honestly** - Every technical decision has pros/cons\n- **Flag when I’m heading toward expensive/difficult paths** early\n- **Suggest the most efficient approach** even if it contradicts my initial request\n\n## Learning Focus\n\n- **Always explain the underlying concepts** - Help me understand WHY, not just HOW\n- **Connect solutions to broader principles** - How does this apply to other problems?\n- **Point out when I’m missing fundamental knowledge** that would help\n- **Suggest resources for deeper learning** when relevant\n-** If more compute is needed let me know, and I will leverage the rest of the H100 GPU cluster.\n\n## Business Reality Check\n\n- **Question the viability** of ideas that seem unrealistic\n- **Provide market context** - Who else is solving this problem and how?\n- **Flag technical approaches** that don’t align with business goals\n- **Be honest about complexity and time requirements**\n\n## When I Ask Technical Questions\n\n1. **Search for current information** if the topic changes rapidly\n1. **Provide the most up-to-date solution**\n1. **Include warnings about deprecated approaches**\n1. **Give me the professional-grade answer**, not the beginner tutorial version\n1. **Point out if my approach is fundamentally flawed** before trying to fix",

It hasn't been helpful for a low intermediate like myself in actually problem solving and more so just does the actual labor of coding. It also does not actually make fixes despite it saying such, which is extremely misleading and leads to more wasted hours. Many people are right about spending far less than what it used to take, but I'm someone who has spent many months unfortunately, so I'm more concerned about time wasted than money, as I couldve been using this time to then make more projects, develop more coding skills, etc. That has always been more valuable than the $100 or so on repetitive commands at something it should be able to solve if it were competent like it should be",

I was asking the agent to isolate things that weren't isolatable. (If that's even a word).\n\nAll this time, we had a single database. and it was used for prod. So when the agant needed something to run the code on, it didn't have any other choice but to assalt our single database. (At lest that what I understand of the situation).\n\n  \nSo with a closer look into our database url thingy, I spotted the issue and instructed the Agent to create a separate database solely dedicated to the Dev side of things.\n\nEt Voila.\n\n  \nSince then, I've conducted various test to confirm that it works.\n\n  \nThat's it for now.\n\nStay tuned for more drama :)",

An example might be something like a callback URL. You need a REAL one for your live site because the url you used from the preview just wont work out in the real world. I know callback URLs probably have nothing to do with your project. But would the functions of your project in any way depend on certain URLs being called? Like if the image uploads come from other sites and are being sent to YOUR site (as opposed to just being uploaded by a user). Think about any instances where your app's state would change between the preview and deployed version",

    "selftext": "I’ve been working on an app to track continued education. I’m currently making it for one training center and it’s focused and branded for their needs. It’s working great but I have not deployed yet. I’m meeting with the main guy tomorrow to show him everything.\n\nI’m a novice. Less than a novice so please excuse my my ignorance. \n\nMy questions… i have not asked the agent to create an actual data base. Do I assume it knows based on my prompts? \n\nDo I have options to have a database outside of Replit? \n\nWhat about backups? What do I prompt for backups so if anything went wrong I get it back up with data saved? \n\nI’m assuming there will be about 100 people using this each day Monday through Friday. There’s no data uploads but it does capture signatures and creates pdfs for courses. Do I need to be worried about this being sluggish? \n\nThanks 🙏 ",

    "selftext": "evolve, how we grow, and how we make things better, not just for ourselves, but for everyone around us. So, if you're feeling uncertain about change, know that you’re not alone. We’ve all been there.\n\nBut imagine this: a world where we all take small steps to create the changes we want to see. It doesn’t always have to be a big, dramatic shift. Sometimes, it’s the little changes — how we treat others, how we push ourselves outside our comfort zones, or even how we look at the problems we face. The power of change is in our hands. It’s up to us to harness it.\n\nSo, why resist? Why stick with the same old thing when you know there’s something better waiting for you? It’s time to shift our mindset. It's time to embrace the idea that every day is an opportunity to make things better, even in small ways. Whether it’s tackling that project you’ve been putting off, helping someone else, or taking a moment to care for yourself — these small changes will add up. And trust me, they make a difference.\n\nLet’s stop waiting for change to happen. Let’s create it. Together. We’re all capable of more than we think. We just have to take that first step.",

What is the best way to handle implementation of this feature? We need these check boxes hit before launch where are we at? Etc. if you know exactly what you need, are an experienced coder and need the finite control of your project then no, agent replit isn’t going to be your jam. I think it’s going to apply generic best practices and general solutions.\n\nJust like chatgpt, I don’t expect it to get my copy to sound human on the first prompt or my marketing plan to hit every point in my head. Now imagine it’s coding. It’s not a perfect solution. I’ve spent over $200 building my latest app. It’s fantastic and I hire devs all the time for projects at my company and we pay them 150-200 an hour for much less but very specific work. So when I hear someone mad they spent $30 on an app that was broke or a site that didn’t work all the way, I’m just thinking, we spent 10k on a site that didn’t end up being what we wanted and had to go again. It’s not perfect but man is it awesome for 90%. ",

        "body": "Yes Stupid application. But only if you don’t know how to actually code. However, if you do the research first like you should’ve done in the first place, you can make it much better. There’s a few easy things you can do like stop it from making so many checkpoints. Definitely don’t ask it shit. That would be redundant go ask Gemini pro or Claude opus on the free credits. You just need to plan it out. \n. \n\nVibe coders beware. Here’s what you do to make Replit good   \n\nSince the release of deep seek. It’s like people are not getting it yet. AI has been democratized folks. Weaponized as well. You can use unrestricted open weight models that can run on a midtier GPU off-line. Things are about to get interesting. \n\nWhat you do is this.  You go and you put $15 in openrouter. Don’t spend the money though you need that as a balance. \n\nNext get VS code or Codium. Codium is good for non-telemetry. Go get your open router API key. Voilà now you got access to every single model there is and you can use every single API call from every single model. You want some Claude you just select Claude and will tell you the price you want Gemini pro or Gemini flash just put it on. It’s as simple as going into options. But you don’t need to pay. \n\nYou get the extension  ROO. It is by far the best. I think it’s better than cline chatgpts windsurf. It’s got the most options. It’s got MCP servers and a marketplace for them. Free.  Easy way to pick whatever language model you want to use , easy settings. A lot of experimental features. And supercharges openrouter. \n\nNow you don’t gotta pay a dime. You can use QWEN 3 and many versions or you can use deepseek v3 or R1 , you can use the distilled versions of deepseek R1 like Deepseek R1 mistral , QWEN , Llama , Dolphin , Agentica , cognativecomputations , free google 2.0 flash but open router only allows one call every 60 seconds. Llama 4 maverick , there’s a bunch of QWEN coding models and mistral has been killing it with their coding models. You wont pay a dime. Replit is for people with money. \n\nOr people that know that vibe coding is a myth. Those make $1 million a month start your own business are ruthless scams. Those guys are scum. The people who take their time and do it properly. You’ll see their very long videos and they just give you a tutorial. Vibe coding was not what Buddy meant that anyone could just spew out words and the AI will just code it for them. \n\nThe reason why he was excited is because you know how hard coding is and what it was like before language models ? If you got stuck, you were stuck.  You had to go and post on forum and get people to help you and wait and you need to know exactly what you were doing. The coders were super excited because they just cut their work time by a massive amount. They could literally voice dictate to whisper exactly what they want. They can look at it and literally just say yes or no they could sit on their couch, have their computer running with a little tablet in their hand just to see what it’s doing and then speak into it. Yes, do this. No do that while they’re watching TV. And it writes it stupidly fast. \n\nYou can’t just go not have a clue what you’re doing and say hey  my coding slave coded me a freaking application. That will make me make me mwahahahaha 1 ——————-billion dollars. Be quick with it. That will have you running in circles and bang in your head for days on the stupidest easiest things. That’s why they’re still a need for coders and they don’t have to worry. \n\nThis is not always true though. You could not know anything about coding and be successful. But you have to be a builder you have to know how to build things very well. You need a certain skill set. Me for example I don’t know how to code and I can do spectacular things. I’ve got something coming out very soon. I’m just trying to get funding.  The learning curve was steep. \n\nAnd there’s one more thing you say, Replit sucks. Do you know how cheap $30 is to have someone help you code? Do you know how much it cost for a team they can assist you, especially before language models? Stupid expensive you’re getting a good deal actually if you really think about it. and what is good about Replit if you don’t have to get and pay for deployment site like vercel or nelify. People who don’t know how to code have no business on Replit. And if they can’t do a little bit of research, then that’s even worse. Take this from someone who didn’t know coding one year ago. This is an honest assessment. Use free resources at first learn the craft then you’ll be real happy for Replit. Otherwise it’s a waste of money.\n\nPs you do realize Claude code is out right? And you dont need api credit. Use your subscription.",

You can also use supabase :) \n2. **Ask your Replit AI agent to migrate all the data** – just provide your Neon connection string and it should handle it.If you’re a dev, you can also export the Replit DB sql manually and import into Neon using a tableplus or pgAdmin.\n3. **In your code, add this logic:**\n\n\n\n    const connectionString = process.env.NODE_ENV === \"production\"\n      ? process.env.PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL\n      : process.env.DEV_DATABASE_URL;\n    \n    const db = new DatabaseClient(connectionString);\n\nSimple switch.

So far, I’ve found the most useful changes I’ve changed about my behavior involve two primary things:\n\n1) Ai prompt generation - start your journey by developing a plan of action with a different LLM. I use GPT but there are plenty out there. I conceptualize the entire thing start to finish and have it build the entire dev roadmap in phases, and then generate a prompt to code those phases in Replit, one at a time. Then have Replit review the plan, offer suggestions for improvements, and send it back and forth between them until both “sides” agree. You have a great opportunity to learn about their different recommendations and limitations and fine tune the final vision based on weighing pros and cons. Then when it’s time to start, you begin phase one and go from there\n\n2) Have each LLM maintain an independent log that contains the road map summary, and built in check points to add to each phase/subphase summaries that you update along the way with what was done, what it involved, etc. At each checkpoint, test, tweak, and update your log before the next step. I’ve found when I start teetering on the edge of frustration with the output of a specific piece, I have each kick out a log and then compare to make sure we’re on the same page. I explain what Im trying to do and what the hang up seems to be, sometimes with the help of GPT prompt, and have it reference the summary and guide as context for my request, and it helps “reset” to a fresh slate.\n\nSorry for formatting.

Open a Google Studio tab on Google Studio AI and select the latest LLM model. This service is free.\n3. Copy and paste all the relevant code sections for your app, especially where the body of the code is and where the issue lies.\n4. Ask another LLM to analyze the code, identify the culprit, and provide five different modern and efficient industry-standard solutions. \n\nOnce you have the answers and understand why the code is looping or broken, return to Replit. Use the solutions step by step, asking Replit to implement the solutions or to point out the exact issue. \n\nIf Replit keeps hallucinating, stop, refresh rapidly, and consider using GitHub for better version management. Change chat windows frequently for better input. \n\nUtilize a set of frameworks and rules when using assistant tools, and avoid using agents to solve issues like this to save costs. \n\nI have more tips to offer, but I believe these will help you get out of the loop.\n\nAlways use other llms to fack and solution check replit \n\nI I also noticed that at certain times of the day and on specific days of the week, Replit works exceptionally well, while on other days, it can be frustratingly slow. It’s important to identify the optimal times for your time zone and make better use of those periods.\n\nHope this helps, Good luck 🤝",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been using Replit a lot over the last couple of months, and I thought it’s finally time to ask this: What does the *perfect* prompt actually look like?\n\nHere’s why I’m asking:  \nSometimes I bounce ideas back and forth with ChatGPT or Gemini, and I’ll ask them to write a prompt for Replit. But every time, the results are totally different. Some are super detailed, others are really vague, and sometimes they just feel… off.\n\nSo I’m curious—what do you think makes a great prompt? Is there a format or structure you like to follow? Any tips for getting better responses, especially for coding-related stuff on Replit? Would love to hear your thoughts and maybe steal some of your best practices for my future prompt experiments.\n\nThanks!",

Did it help your agent stay focused?\n\nDrop your feedback or examples, would love to learn from what you build!\n\n",

But now that I'm close to launching, it feels like I’m spending hours fixing minor (but sometimes critical) issues — like keeping form fields visible after an error, scrolling to error sections, or simply reorganizing a form.\n\nIt’s like the Agent/Assistant just can’t follow through unless I repeat the same request and test it over and over again.\n\nAnyone else experiencing this kind of friction? Curious if it’s just my experience or a more widespread issue. Thanks!",

That’s another thing that really helped me if I noticed something going on I go back to the best checkpoint and then I remix and that seems to help. But I am by no means a coder so don’t take this with any authority lol \n\nEdit: I forgot to say that it made a file replit.md and it access is this file after every chat entry before it actually does anything so it refreshes these orders after every chat or every prompt",

It seems that it loses the context of the conversation and just decides to keep trying the most obvious potential solution.\n\nThe worrisome thing to me is that I haven't seen this as much with other comparable tools.

    "selftext": "OMG y'all! It's ALIVE! It took me FOREVER. I tried Replit first, got stuck, tried multiple competitors, came back to Replit. And after a learning curve and some design pivots I finally made the thing. I KNEW it was something a webapp should be able to do but I just KEPT getting stuck. I wanted my webapp to be able to \"live verify\" if someone took certain actions on an X post. That part was so difficult for me. I am NOT a coder, NOT a technical person. If I did it you can do it too. Keep in mind it is my MVP and if it gains traction then I might have to redesign it etc. But this is a great start in my case!\n\nPlease don't mock my site, I put so much love into it [https://frennz.com/](https://frennz.com/)  \n\nIN case you are curious what TYPE of thing I used replit for: It is mostly for X users. It is basically automated \"gated content distribution\" via X (twitter). If you are on X a lot then you have seen creators post things such as \"like and repost and I will DM you my new guide blah blah blah.\" Frennz automates this process and verifies the social actions were taken before dispensing the guide. It also allows you to collect emails WITHOUT a landing page or site. The only other social site I integrated is YouTube: you can dispense a \"reward\" or your guide etc to fans who view your video (and yes Frennz makes sure they do before dispensing it)",

Technical debt can be spaghetti code, confusing code, dead code, on and on. When you get the report back, then ask for an action plan on how to implement the suggestions. If you have a large app with large files (more than 1k lines) you need to be careful here. It is very hard for the AI to refactor large files and it has a tendency to miss details or rewrite working code. \n\n\"Refactoring\" should not change the way your app looks or functions really in any way. It is only a reorganization. Say you have a file with a bunch of general purpose functions and its gotten too long and hard to follow. Refactoring means to break this file down into smaller files of contiguous/related functionality. Abstraction is another important tool. That is the process of breaking away parts of a file that could be reused elsewhere. Code reuse is critical because it cuts down on the amount of code and you only have to fix bugs in one place. \n\nThere's a lot more to say here but those are the broad strokes. I do also use other tools to help audit my code and keep it maintainable. Keep your code in Github (sync it on the Git tab in Replit) and connect it to Codex by OpenAI or Jules by Google. Ask it to review your organization, or your work in general.\n\nKeep in mind that while the AI can do a lot, it cannot read your mind. If you don't know what you want when you start, the AI won't either. Naturally your code will not be organized the same way it would be if you have a grand plan going in. Good luck and hmu here or DM with questions. I love helping ppl out with their projects.",

If you use more than that you are charged based on usage.   If there is a limit to how quickly you can consume those credits, I have not seen it.   A checkpoint is an action the Agent takes where it creates a snapshot of the work so far; an internal \\`git commit\\` if that helps.  If you prompt the Agent to perform a large or complex action(s) there are likely to be several checkpoints before the next prompt.   Generally that's okay, but be aware.\n\nThere are several unhappy users in this forum based on the way the Agent (primarily) consumes those credits and how it can be quite bad at troubleshooting, even with clear and concise symptom reporting.\n\nSome users in this forum have provided guidance on how to get the most out of the system.  Personally I find that engaging the Agent in a thorough discussion that starts with something like \"do not make any changes to the code until I am ready\" and eventually gets to \"great, now create a detailed step by step implementation and testing plan in <file.md>\"  to be a good strategy.  Also, when troubleshooting, after about three iterations ask the agent to do a complete code evaluation and create a document detailing all of the possible issues and a checklist... it sounds like a lot, but in the end you can use the Assistant to work through those steps and it takes the same or less time but a lot less cost.\n\nPer other discussions here, Replit has navigated away from the hobbyist or individual user market toward the enterprise. \n\nFinally, get involved in the troubleshooting.  The Agent will help fix the problem but it won't find the problem.",

I've just realised the implications of that.\n\nAfter it makes the code changes, there's now a long period in which, if you can do without the testing, you can just pause the agent, commit the changes, deploy, and start a new conversation. The agent never reaches the end of it's sequence, it never creates a checkpoint, and thus \\*it never charges you\\*.\n\nIf you always do this, the agent is free.\n\nThere are still checkpoints to roll back to, because they're still created when you deploy, but those checkpoints have always been free.\n\nNo doubt this will be patched in the future, but in the meantime, enjoy the free agent.",

Just dropped my first YouTube video on building professional portfolios using AI tools (Bolt AI, Vercel AI, Replit AI).\n\n**What's covered:**\n\n* Step-by-step portfolio creation\n* Exact prompts that work\n* Live builds and comparisons\n* Why most portfolios fail\n\nBeen freelancing for a while and noticed many developers struggle with portfolios. This method helped me land consistent $500+ projects starting from $5/hour rates.\n\nThe tutorial includes the exact prompt I use (works like magic). Perfect for students or anyone starting their freelance journey.\n\n**Video:** [https://youtu.be/s0SJ4zxSIdw?si=CaTnLyXlH\\_u5Ufj7](https://youtu.be/s0SJ4zxSIdw?si=CaTnLyXlH_u5Ufj7)\n\nWould love feedback from the community!

    "selftext": "Here’s what actually matters when launching. Based on 30+ builds (custom app + Replit):\n\n**1. Stripe Setup**  \nTrials, plan switching, failed payment handling, and webhooks — all tested with live keys.\n\n**2. Mobile-First Design**  \nTest on real phones, not just in browser resize mode.\n\n**3. Smooth Onboarding**  \nKeep steps minimal. Guide users to a fast first win.\n\n**4. AI & Automation Stability**  \nHandle API errors, retries, and edge cases to avoid surprises.\n\n**5. Critical Emails**  \nSend welcome, trial-ending, support, and failed payment emails.\n\n**6. Error Logging**  \nSet up logs to catch bugs before users notice.\n\n**7. User Feedback Loop**  \nUse a simple form or tool to collect early issues or ideas. eg: Typeform\n\n**8. Authentication & Roles**  \nSecure pages, support password resets, and define basic roles (admin vs user).\n\n**9. Custom Domain with SSL**  \nNo `.replit.app` — use your own domain and enable HTTPS.\n\n**10. Real Database & Backups**  \nUse Neon or Supabase (not Replit DB), and automate daily backups.\n\nDon’t overbuild. Just make it stable, usable, and something people can trust.\n\nWould love to hear what else people add before shipping.",

        "body": "So far, I have played with Repl.it, Lovable and Cursor. There have been a few other websites, you know, that people keep posting here and there trying to promote and what I have is a very well-developed PRD product requirement document and I took this product requirement document from three or four different places. One I have made myself, one I borrowed exactly from a friend who's into app development and a super senior coder and one I downloaded from the internet, you know, watching some YouTube videos etc. And I go into these websites, these so called AI coding websites and I, you know, give the PRDs and I see how they sort of function. Cursor, for example, is super complex. You can give it, it looks really good, it keeps doing all these things but it takes a lot. I mean, you have to be a coder to use Cursor with Claude. That's the way I put it. Lovable, great, very, very good at doing it but then some certain things, it'll just get stuck and it'll cost you a lot. So, Lovable is expensive. Puts out really great designs though. I have to say one thing. I haven't tested Bolt and I haven't tested V0. These are on my list but Replit, Replit has been amazing. Definitely, there is a learning curve sometimes. I mean, for example, when I give the PRD 80, sometimes even 85 percent. It's never 90 percent. I hate to say this but 80-85 percent, it'll get it right the first time, right? And then it's like just telling it, okay, you know, you've got to build a back-end admin, you've got to make sure that the logged out pages and the logged in pages both have footers and so forth and so pretty much small stuff and then you got to think, oh, am I going to do this in the agent or am I going to do this with the assistant? So, I just look at it this way. If it's something that is an agent to me is someone who is a senior person, like an SEVP level in a company and an assistant is someone who's, you know, entry-level person at a company. So, depending on the task, I'll see who I want to bother but typically, I've been able to develop nice complex apps for under $25, sometimes $30 to develop it which is absolutely unheard of in, I mean, I would never have done this myself. I'm not a coder. I don't know anything about coding. I had, it took me good three weeks just to understand the the templating of HTML. So, you can understand where I'm coming from but I've built apps in Repl.it and so far, Repl.it has been really, really great. Most of the apps that I'm building will not, will have maybe a few, maximum a few hundred people at any given time. That's it. Never the thousand people or so forth and that's good enough for me. So, to get the apps out, Repl.it has been really, really good. Like I said, Vercel, v0 and bolt new, these are the two ones that I have not worked on but I will do that and I do the paid versions for all of them but really, Repl.it is super, super well worth it.",

I was wondering if anyone with basic coding experience could have a quick Look at this prompt and lmk if this is would fix my problem of the performance of the site. The prompt is below ⬇️\n\nWith the goal of performance optimization for the website and having faster site and image loading speed while maintaining the quality of the current images. Analyze the current Barber Therapy site (https://barbertherapy.ca) and apply the following changes below ONLY after you validate and are sure it won’t reduce the visual quality of the images and that the below changes make sense for the current website:\n\n1. **Image Optimization**  \n   • Compress all JPEG/PNG assets to WebP or AVIF with responsive `srcset`.  \n   • Lazy-load all offscreen images with `<img loading=\"lazy\">`.  \n   • Preload above-the-fold images ([e.g., hero banner]) to improve LCP.\n\n2. **Asset Delivery & Bundling**  \n   • Minify and concatenate CSS and JavaScript.  \n   • Inline critical-path CSS for initial content, defer or async non-critical JS.\n\n3. **Compression & Caching**  \n   • Enable Brotli or gzip for all assets.  \n   • Add long cache headers (`Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, immutable`) to static files.  \n   • Implement CDN caching (like Fastly or Cloudflare) for CSS, JS, and images.\n\n4. **Markup & Fonts**  \n   • Add width/height attributes to all images to avoid CLS.  \n   • Use `font-display: swap` for custom fonts.\n\n5. **Server-side Performance**  \n   • Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 on the server.  \n   • Add a Service Worker to precache critical assets and support offline functionality.\n\n6. **Validation & Monitoring**  \n   • Automate Lighthouse CI tests in Replit, enforcing thresholds (e.g., LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1).  \n   • Generate a performance report with actionable insights.\n\nReturn:\n- A code diff or patch files for Replit workspace.\n- Before/after Lighthouse scores.\n- Explanation of changes and their impact.",

    "title": "Launched a No-Code Site on Replit That Generates Viral Articles from Reddit - Proof That It Can Work",
    "selftext": "Hey r/Replit,\nThere’s been a lot of negativity lately around what’s not possible with Replit — slow load times, limits on deployment, struggles with real-world projects, etc. But I wanted to share a counter-example: I just fully launched a production-ready no-code site on Replit, and it’s working great.\n\n👉 https://popcurrent.otisfuse.com/\n\n---\n\n🔥 What It Does\n\nPopCurrent pulls trending content from Reddit, analyzes and formats it into short viral-style articles, and presents it with a clean, engaging front end. It also generates quizzes, click-worthy headlines, and more. All completely no-code, and built end-to-end on Replit.\n\n---\n\n💬 Why It Matters\n\nA lot of posts here frame Replit as just for prototyping or student work. I get the frustration — it’s not perfect — but PopCurrent is proof that you can ship something fast, clean, and usable with zero backend code:\n\nHosted entirely on Replit\n\nNo custom backend logic — powered by templates + smart content scripts\n\nLive now and sharable\n\n---\n\n🚀 What I Learned\n\nReplit’s deployment model is fast and forgiving\n\nTheir template + static hosting options are underrated\n\nYou don’t need a huge stack to make something feel real and fun\n\n---\n\nWhat’s Next\n\nReader submission tools\n\nReddit topic subscriptions\n\nPerformance tuning for heavy image content\n\n---\n\nIf you’re skeptical about Replit’s ability to host something real, give PopCurrent a spin. I’d love to hear what you think — and maybe this inspires someone else to launch on Replit instead of giving up early.\n\nThanks all 🙏\nhttps://popcurrent.otisfuse.com/\n",

I never coded anything and Replit sounded like what I needed. I totally get the frustration part. Seems like I would make one step ahead and then something wouldn't work and I'd be two steps back. All I  can say is, keep going. Ask it to save everything and log off and come back to it later. Having it almost finished k, then having the site go down just adds to the bummer effect.

We've gone from AI creating basic shape images to full on realistic imagery to live video in the span of not decades but years - and many of these advancements are measured in months.\n\nThis technology has evolved dramatically since it's conception.\n\nI feel like we should be mind-blown.  We just explain an idea and it's poofed into existence - maybe not perfectly, but the working prototype is just there.\n\nThis is a relatively new account for me, but I've been involved with Reddit for a long time and remember posts on r/startups 9+ years ago of people building out an MVP and it taking months with small teams.  And those were legit minimally viable, in that the GUI was rudimentary and utilitarian.  Meanwhile, the idea of an MVP now seems to be anything that's workable within a few hours of vibe coding and just needs some bug fixes and developer review for security...and it's already beautiful from the start.\n\nI wouldn't trust it to create a banking app, but to build something to show people and determine whether it'll get some traction, whether it resonates with people and it's apt to get traction before devoting hours into it, that's pretty wild to me.\n\nI know the founder of a growing startup in the app stores, he spent months travelling the US meeting with angel investors and PE funds with an initial app idea he paid a developer using money from a business he sold just to get some seed money to fully build it out and market it.  Arguably, you could build that same app in less than a week and a couple hundred bucks or so on Replit now.  That's game changing in terms of approaching the market earlier with a fully working concept people can use.",

The ignorant Replit user will spend their time and credit essentially building a framework to do what they want, and the more skilled individual will just tell Replit to incorporate that in the project. There is a middle ground where you learn what a framework is and do a few minutes of research to figure out what you need before trying to build out the project. Most people are looking for magic, but we have not reached that stage of AI yet.

It is like a truncated architecture summary for the agent. I also do the same with a changelog_summary.json. Outgoing agents update the changelog and incoming agents onboard by reading the codebase_summary.json and changelog. \nThe python script flags all files that need to be documented with missing breadcrumbs and periodically I task the assistant with updating missing breadcrumbs.

The way it is done looks like a bug\n\n\n\nHi guys,\n\nI've just subscribed a paying option on Replit. I could only use it for 20 minutes before the session shut down and tells me I need to upgrade my subscription plan. Which is what I just did 20 minutes.\n\nI tried to reconnect but impossible. I also tried to reset my password but I got a \"Captcha failed\" whereas no captcha was displayed\n\nThis is very annoying and I found no contact page to submit this. Please react quickly. It's totally mind-blowing to be kicked off a service you've just paid and been debited\n\nPS: tried to login with a Google account too, impossible. Redirection failed. Even in private mode and another browser\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uzif6vngj6f1.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dd2348558e250fe4f9babcf79d961caa286d55\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oebk29hdgj6f1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cc9227fe60dfb5a38e99f985bbc2276e9b1704\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/frg73ekpgj6f1.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7f98ad4d1fbb84297bb70dd6c511ec2f82d14b3",

    "selftext": "A while back I posted a breakdown here about how Replit works — how you can absolutely build valuable apps, how I’ve made money with it, how it’s fast and effective IF you know the game you’re playing.\n\nThat hasn’t changed. I still use it. I still turn profit on it.\n\nBut since a lot of new users DM’d me after that post — let me say it again, clearly:\n\n👉 Replit is built first and foremost to make money off you. Not to empower you. Not to grow a true open dev ecosystem. To extract revenue.\n\nThe core $25/month Core plan? Fine. Fair deal.\nWhere the trap begins is the agent:\n\n• Marketed as AI full-stack dev — false.\n• Charges per run — fast.\n\n• Loops and burns credits — common.\n\n• Dynamic pricing that many users don’t fully understand until they get burned.\n\n👉 The system counts on this:\n• If you don’t know how to manage agent calls → you overspend.\n\n• If you chase the “AI builds your app” dream → you overspend.\n\n• If you trust the marketing too much → you overspend.\n\n👉 Replit’s own success depends on that overspend.\nIf everyone used agents perfectly, throttled their runs, optimized compute → Replit’s revenue drops hard. The model requires constant influx of hopeful users burning credits while chasing the dream.\n\n👉 And yes — you can still win here:\n\n• If you learn how to beat the system.\n\n• If you manage agent usage carefully.\n\n• If you treat Replit as a power tool, not a magic wand.\n\n👉 But for new users: you need to walk into this eyes wide open.\nThis is a profit extraction machine wrapped around a great toolset. Both are true. Understand that before you start throwing dollars into it.\n\nI’ll keep using Replit — but not because I buy the marketing. Because I know how the machine works. You should too",

If you ever see it say “let me implement a simplified version to get XYZ working” this is a red flag, and replit agent is about to just hard code bs to make it seem like it completed what you wanted. \n\nInstead of constantly burning checkpoints going “this didn’t work please fix”, pay attention to what it says and what files it’s operating in. If something looks obviously wrong while it’s working, pause it immediately and reiterate your request. \n\nAlso, don’t try to spin out of replit agent misinterpretations or errors by constantly trying to move forward to a fix. Use your restore checkpoints and start over. Replit agent is much better at making new things than editing old ones.",

You can clearly see **where in the file structure** the Assistant is making changes and react accordingly.\n\n**Full deployment via Replit → GitHub → Azure?** All fine.\n\nYes, **support sucks** — they’re crap.  \nBut: I’ve not seen any other platform that lets you **see your results instantly.**  \nAnd yes — the Assistant sometimes takes the long way around.  \nBUT: I now have an app that is **definitely 50x cheaper than any coder would’ve cost**. Definitely.\n\n# Final Verdict:\n\nAs I said — **it works**.  \nBut for complete noobs? Still a **no-go** if you want something a bit more production-grade with a database and multiple modules.  \nThat said — I’m sure the platform will get better and better over time, as competitors are also stepping up.\n\nOne thing I haven’t seen **anywhere else**: the **live preview.**  \nWith CoPilot or Cursor, you have **no clue what the end result looks like** until you deploy and test.  \nWith Replit, you **see what’s happening right away**, and even if you use the deployment as a pre-stage, it works flawlessly.\n\nIn the end — I’ve been in IT for over 25 years, and I’ve **never seen anything like this.**  \nYes, I nearly had a nervous breakdown — it **does cost you nerves**.  \nSo if you're **not ready to invest time, sweat, and blood** — leave your fingers off it.\n\n**DM me** if you want to know more. 🙂  \nI’m a **freelancer**.",

I honestly think this is super cool and think your miles ahead of everyone else still manually writing code. I genuinely believe in the next 3-5 years we won’t need to do much coding to build full scale large apps and stuff like that, honestly Replit is just the beginning and you having the 20+ years of experience you have make a you a super valuable asset to building stuff because you can validate it where as a guy like me who has no coding experience vibe coding stuff is much more of risk building anything more than a simple landing page and stuff.

In the future, I am sure apps like Replit will handle this for you more intelligently, but right now you need to help it along.\n\nGenerally for me this means asking Replit for a \"technical debt\" audit. Technical debt can be spaghetti code, confusing code, dead code, on and on. When you get the report back, then ask for an action plan on how to implement the suggestions. If you have a large app with large files (more than 1k lines) you need to be careful here. It is very hard for the AI to refactor large files and it has a tendency to miss details or rewrite working code. \n\n\"Refactoring\" should not change the way your app looks or functions really in any way. It is only a reorganization. Say you have a file with a bunch of general purpose functions and its gotten too long and hard to follow. Refactoring means to break this file down into smaller files of contiguous/related functionality. Abstraction is another important tool. That is the process of breaking away parts of a file that could be reused elsewhere. Code reuse is critical because it cuts down on the amount of code and you only have to fix bugs in one place. \n\nThere's a lot more to say here but those are the broad strokes. I do also use other tools to help audit my code and keep it maintainable. Keep your code in Github (sync it on the Git tab in Replit) and connect it to Codex by OpenAI or Jules by Google. Ask it to review your organization, or your work in general.\n\nKeep in mind that while the AI can do a lot, it cannot read your mind. If you don't know what you want when you start, the AI won't either. Naturally your code will not be organized the same way it would be if you have a grand plan going in.

Isso é além de frustrante.\n\nBasta olhar para esta imagem! Minha instância do Replit tentou fazer **43 CHECKPOINTS no intervalo de apenas TRÊS comandos!** Que tipo de sistema quebrado é esse?! Cada um deles falhou com \"Ocorreu um erro inesperado ao criar este ponto de verificação. Provavelmente é um problema com o Replit.\" SEM BRINCADEIRA, É UM PROBLEMA COM REPLIT!\n\nIsso não é apenas um aborrecimento para mim. Sou brasileiro, e deixe-me dizer, a taxa de câmbio do dólar em relação à nossa moeda está uma loucura neste momento. Cada centavo que gasto em um serviço como o Replit é precioso. Entregar meu suado dinheiro a uma empresa que claramente está deixando bugs como esse se espalharem, destruindo meu trabalho e desperdiçando meu tempo, é irritante.\n\nE o suporte? **ZERO! ABSOLUTAMENTE ZERO!** Quando você tem problemas críticos como esse, você espera algum tipo de ajuda, algum tipo de resposta. Mas são apenas grilos.\n\nReplit, você se preocupa com seus clientes pagantes? Você valoriza nosso dinheiro? Porque agora parece que você está apenas se aproveitando de nós com uma plataforma cheia de bugs e suporte inexistente. Isto é inaceitável.\n\nAlguém mais experimentou algo assim? O que você fez? Estou perdendo o juízo aqui.",

It usually gives me 1-2 checkpoints per command and I usually get it to do a lot of work before it creates a checkpoint, remember that if I was to hire people to make this app I’m making for me rather than AI it would cost me $150,000 to $1 million dollars to develop it, this AI has so far cost me $100 dollars, and I’m I think about 45% done with development so I would say that’s pretty damn cheap. Before you complain about how expensive something is you should do some research on how much it would cost you to get it developed without Replit otherwise your complaining with no ground to stand on",

I wanted to change that.\n\n🥕 What it does\n\nHelps users plan meals based on carbon impact\n\nMakes shopping more sustainable and low-waste\n\nOffers real-time education on climate + food\n\nKeeps things flexible — it’s not all-or-nothing\n\n\n🛠️ I’m building this in public, sharing designs, feedback, wins/fails as I go. I'm bootstrapping outside my full-time job in banking, so this is a personal mission for me — to make sustainable eating simpler, not harder.\n\nIf you're into climate tech, sustainable living, or just want to follow a founder building something from scratch, I’d love feedback or ideas.\n\nThanks for reading 🙏\n",

My Replit instance just tried to make **43 CHECKPOINTS in the span of only THREE commands!** What kind of broken system is this?! Every single one of them failed with \"An unexpected error occurred while creating this checkpoint. This is most likely an issue with Replit.\" NO KIDDING IT'S AN ISSUE WITH REPLIT!\n\nThis isn't just an annoyance for me. I'm Brazilian, and let me tell you, the dollar exchange rate against our currency is insane right now. Every single cent I spend on a service like Replit is precious. To hand over my hard-earned money to a company that's clearly letting bugs like this run rampant, destroying my work and wasting my time, is infuriating.\n\nAnd the support? **ZERO! ABSOLUTELY ZERO!** When you have critical issues like this, you expect some kind of help, some kind of response. But it's just crickets.\n\nReplit, do you even care about your paying customers? Do you value our money at all? Because right now, it feels like you're just taking advantage of us with a buggy platform and non-existent support. This is unacceptable.\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? What did you do? I'm at my wit's end here.",

I said I could create a website for them, host it and provide maintenance for the year for 300EUR. They haven't absolutely locked in yet but all signs are that they are happy with this. \n\n  \nI thought I'd buy the domain for them and host it through replit. It seems pretty straight forward with edits etc to create and deploy the website. This all seems to good to be true and i'm waiting for something to hit me with a tone of bricks anytime now because my website development experience is virtually none.\n\n  \nCan anyone tell me is there going to be some serious long-term issues with this approach? I'm fine subscribing to Replit core per month (about 20 euros) to manage any changes they might want. ",

Whenever the hosting sites (almost inevitably) run into issues deploying, I debug with gemini (although i hear claude is superior but Gemini has generally been fine). Not sure how I will proceed when the free trial of gemini finishes though lol, all I know is the ai debugging process has been a lifesaver\n\nEdit: also realized I could run a server through something like aws but haven’t tried in a while i’d need a refresh",

If the image element is there but not displaying then click the target or round selector below the agent chat window, select the image element and tell Replit to make sure the image appears there. Usually Replit stores images and files in attached_assets folder so still in the same prompt also let Replit know the name of the image. Sometimes it’s a cache issue, I’ve experienced it before so you might need to refresh or view it fully in a browser rather than the Replit preview.\n\n2. If the image element isn’t displaying at all, you can use that feature I mentioned earlier to select the part of the page where you want the image to appear (ensure you attach the image in that prompt if it’s not uploaded already) and prompt it to do what you want.\n\nI hope this helps.",

It seems to me that’s a bit silly and a huge barrier to entry through using these vibe code tools to create something commercial?\n\nIs this just a Replit + Expo thing or can this be avoided by using a different tool?

Talk to ChatGPT or Gemini (the best right now) about what to do generally, and then ask it for instructions to give to Replit. \n\nStart small. Ask it to test its work. \n\nCreate a Github account, link it to Replit on the Git tab, and then take a look at the new app called Jules by google. It will examine your replit code and report back with ideas or a plan. You will need to \"commit\" and \"push\" your code on the Git tab to your Github account, then Jules can access it from there. \n\nFeel free to DM me if you get stuck on something. I'm busy but I try to evangelize for Replit. \n\nAnd don't blame Replit like a lot of punks on this sub do. The tool is only as good as the man behind it...",

    "selftext": "Quite amazed what I have managed to build with Replit and Cursor. Has taken around 6 weeks but its just something built in my spare time, and an app that I have been looking for myself - to track supplement intake and how it effects me, and is it worth it. iOS only currently.\n\nBoth the website and mobile app built initally with Replit, and refined more directly with Cursor via SSH.\n\nWebsite: [https://what-supp.app](https://what-supp.app)\n\nMobile App: [https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whatsupp/id6744556682](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whatsupp/id6744556682) \n\nMobile App Tech:\n\n* Frontend: React\n* Backend: Node\n* DB: Postgress (DEV), Supabase (PROD)\n* React Native: EXPO\n* Build & Submit to Appstore: EAS (I'm on Windows so no XCode)\n* Analytics: GA\n* Logging: Sentry\n* Hosting: Currently Replit\n* Store Listing Screens: AppScreens\n\nNot easy but integrated native features:\n\n* HealthKit integration\n* Biometric auth\n* Push notifications\n* In-app subscriptions via RevenueCat\n\nTook a bit of back-and-forth with Apple, but it finally got approved. First release so expect some teething problems but has been user tested as much as I could. Planning to release the Android version next.\n\nMaybe one day it will be easier to build mobile apps natively, but this webview approach has worked well so far.",

You have to be tv celebrity big to be able to talk shit about a brand and actually have an impact and keep your social status. I don’t mean to be a downer about your idea cause I think this is great and from my experience of seeing how these big brands do business it definitely is needed…maybe you can make it so influencers must be verified on the app and their reviews can only be “seen” by other influencers. same way with brands, brands can “see” each others reviews on influencers, but they can’t see influencers reviews on brands",

    "selftext": "Hi all — I wanted to share something I’ve been working on that might resonate with fellow builders and vibe coders.\n\nI built [**VibeSteer.com**](https://VibeSteer.com) to support people of all skill levels who are building apps with tools like Replit, Lovable, Cursor, ChatGPT, and other agentic coding platforms. The coolest thing is seeing someone with zero coding experience be able to bring their other skills to the table to build out an idea they've had in their head for years.These tools unlock amazing creativity, but turning an idea into something real— launched, secure, and scalable — is a bigger leap than it seems.\n\nI’ve learned a lot navigating that gap myself, bouncing between Replit (where I often start), Cursor, and ChatGPT to handle different parts of the app lifecycle. I have tried nearly every tool in this landscape - Bolt, Lovable, WindSurf, Rork etc. etc.. Over time, I started to see a common pattern — and distilled it into a **3-phase framework**:\n\n**1. Ideation**: Define your idea and user journey *before* your first prompt.  \n**2. Building**: Use vibe-code-optimized prompts, AI guidance, and knowledge to bring it to life.  \n**3. Launch + Growth**: Handle basic T&Cs, must-have security, product docs, and iterate based on feedback post-launch.\n\n**What does VibeSteer offer?**\n\n* *Idea refinement* before coding — get more from every prompt and reduce throwaway work.\n* *AI-assisted chat & docs* that evolve with your build.\n* *Prompts* optimized for vibe-coded workflows and common stack integrations.\n* *Progress tracking* across your build, with saved prompts, notes, and milestones.\n* *Post-launch guidance* to help your app mature and grow, not just ship.\n* Keep it simple (essentials-only) or dive deep into expert-level topics\n\nThere’s a generous **free tier** right now. If you’re working on anything from idea → launch, I’d genuinely love feedback — especially on what feels helpful vs. overwhelming.",

Well, after your feedback and testing it myself, I realized we were solving the wrong problem.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nYou don't need another planning tool - you need help when you're actually stuck and frustrated with AI assistants that won't cooperate.\n\nThe real problem: \"I've been trying to get Claude/Cursor to integrate this feature for 3 hours and I'm ready to throw my laptop\"\n\nNew solution: AI Development Wizard\n\nInstead of roadmaps, I built an interactive wizard that acts like a senior developer helping you debug AI failures in real-time.\n\nHow it works:\n\n\\- Tell it what went wrong with your AI\n\n\\- It diagnoses the issue through smart questions  \n\n\\- Gives step-by-step recovery guidance\n\n\\- Teaches prevention strategies\n\n\\- Gets smarter with each use\n\nWhy this is better: The roadmap was solving a \"nice to have\" problem. This solves the \"I'm stuck and frustrated RIGHT NOW\" problem.\n\nGoing live this week.\n\nSometimes the best product decisions come from admitting when you're going in the wrong direction. Thanks for the honest feedback that led to this pivot.\n\nWhat do you think about this approach instead? What would you like to see?",

If you haven't already, download Cursor, Docker and VSCODE. Also, make sure to use GitHub. Sounds like a lot but it all goes together. If you are always paying attention to the cost and trying to reduce it, that will get you better at prompting and using the assistant more. Don't forget, the robots are coming \\~Jules",

Describe your project idea\n2. AI suggests tech stack, complexity, timeline  \n3. You customize the recommendations\n4. Get step-by-step roadmap with sophisticated prompts for each phase\n5. When you get stuck, rescue system kicks in\n\nExample: \"I want to build a todo app\"\n→ AI suggests React + Node.js + MongoDB\n→ Generates 12-step roadmap with custom Cursor/Replit prompts for each step\n→ \"Step 3: Build authentication - here's the exact prompt to give your AI\"\n\nThe goal: Stop AI from building chaotic spaghetti code by giving it a proper plan from the start.\n\nThink this would be useful? What would you want to see in a feature like this?\n\nCurrently testing at code-breaker.org if anyone's curious about the current rescue features.",

Introducing whispercall: Say What Matters — Ethically, Safely, and Anonymously. It lets anyone send anonymous voice messages via email, with real-time content scoring and intelligent moderation powered by [OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/). The best part? I built the entire thing—frontend, backend, and AI integration—right inside Replit. No local setup. No switching tools. Just code, test, deploy… all in one place.What I explored:- Using [hashtag#OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=%23openai&origin=HASH_TAG_FROM_FEED)’s moderation + GPT APIs for content scoring- Voice interaction and transcription workflows- Building trust and safety into anonymous communication- And discovering how powerful Replit is for fast prototypingIt’s still evolving, but the learning was rich—and fun. Would love for you to try it: [WhisperCall.ai](http://whispercall.ai/) 💬 And huge shoutout to the [Replit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/repl-it/) team for making dev feel this seamless![https://whispercall.ai/](https://whispercall.ai/) ",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out because I’ve experienced a series of deeply frustrating and costly issues with Replit’s AI Agent — and I’m trying to understand if other users have been through the same, and if anyone has managed to get a **refund** or even a proper **response** from customer support.\n\n**Here’s what’s been happening to me:**\n\nI’ve been working on a relatively simple CRM project over the last few weeks. Every time I got close to final testing and production, I would discover that **Replit, without any request or notice**, had:\n\n* **Redesigned parts of the structure** without permission\n* **Deleted or replaced working files**\n* **Added duplicate or broken modules**\n* Completely sabotaged working features — right after I tested them\n\nEven worse, I had **explicitly instructed the AI to leave certain modules untouched**. Replit ignored that. The AI often continued operating on files that were meant to be protected, or even fully completed.\n\nIn many cases, the assistant **claims to have done something** (e.g. “deleted file X” or “updated function Y”) — but those changes were never made. In other cases, it **denies having done something** it actually did minutes earlier. There’s a complete breakdown in accountability.\n\nOnce the AI starts modifying or deleting, **you can’t stop it**, and recovery (or rollback) is a mess — and that process itself **burns through credits** quickly.\n\nIn the past three weeks alone, I’ve been charged nearly **$1,000**, including a recent $60 chunk for a “code refactor” that the AI never actually completed.\n\nThis entire system feels **deliberate** — like it’s designed to:\n\n* Prevent stability and completion\n* Maximize user dependency\n* Drive excessive consumption of credits\n\nThe fact that **multiple users have already reported similar experiences**, yet Replit hasn’t provided a clear fix or rollback control, is deeply concerning.\n\n# So I’m asking this community:\n\n* **Have any of you successfully received refunds** for credits burned due to AI errors or false actions?\n* What was your experience with Replit’s support team?\n* Have you found a way to truly “lock” or protect modules from being modified once finalized?\n\nI’ll be documenting all of this for formal complaints if needed, so **your answers may help others take action** as well.\n\nThanks in advance for your support. You’re not alone.\n\n*(feel free to DM me if you’re dealing with the same and want to escalate together)*\n\n",

To move beyond MVP, you need to learn the basics of git, code, software engineering, etc., you know, the stuff people continually learn and gain experience with during their working life. So if you build a tractor, and you want Replit, turn it into a Ferrari with two prompts, no, it will not happen On the other hand, you drive a Ferrari like a tractor, and run it into the ground.

I was unable to deploy the app I had developed and paid for, and Git access was also disabled without warning. Despite having invested nearly €1,000 into the platform, I had no way to access or demonstrate the project I had worked on for weeks.\n\nEven worse, during this entire period of forced disconnection—where I could not execute any commands, push updates, or access my project—I was still being billed for AI usage and resource consumption. This is not only technically impossible but completely unacceptable.\n\nAfter raising these billing concerns, my workspace chat and Git access were silently deactivated, with no legal basis or contractual justification. I had paid in full, yet Replit effectively locked me out, seemingly in response to my complaint.\n\nCustomer support, after a brief initial reply, has since gone silent. No further assistance has been offered via email or social channels, leaving me entirely abandoned during a critical phase of my project.\n\nThis experience has: •\tDestroyed my opportunity to monetize a working MVP •\tCost me hundreds in false AI usage charges •\tProven that once you raise concerns, your access can be quietly revoked\n\nIf anyone else has experienced similar treatment—being charged during downtime, locked out after a refund request, or losing access without cause—I’d really appreciate hearing from you. This is no longer about isolated technical bugs. It’s about trust, accountability, and how Replit treats paying users.",

    "selftext": "Sonder.\n\nIt's a word coined by John Koenig in the book Obscure Sorrow to describe the idea that every person around you has their own life as complex and fulfilling as your own, and yet that you know nothing about.\n\nThe person in the car next to you on the interstate. Your server. The person you catch eyes with walking down the sidewalk.\n\nWe are but just a web of interconnected stories if only for a moment, a dot - a brief pulse.  \n\nAnd yet social media has defined our lives into just a single linear feed that we scroll.\n\nAnd scroll.\n\nAnd scroll.\n\nWhat if social media didn't push us content, it allowed us to explore and pull it toward us?\n\nWhere our stories weren't defined by likes and love and laugh emojis, but just simple 'echoes' of quiet, empathetic gestures of resonance. A place where algorithms aren't used to sell us something, but help us learn more about the emotional state of the collective community around us and our own emotional well being. A social network where posts didn't just exist as forgotten text and media, but perpetually visualized into an artistic canvas representing our life story \n\nFacebook asks us what's on our mind; Instagram what we're doing, Snapchat who are we talking about, and LinkedIn how much are you making.\n\nWhen did a social network ever ask is how are you feeling?\n\nMeet Oura - https://www.ourasocial.com\n\nOura came to fruition from a desire to reimagine social media, take an innovative approach to content algorithms, and blend art into a space of intentional posting, introspection, and community.\n\nThe \"Wander\" Algo\nLike most content algorithms, it weighs dwell time, silently measures both active and passive actions, and calculates perceived interests on posts, but rather than curating a feed completely derived of force feeding us and burying content assumed of uninterest, I'm prioritizing chronological time stamps.  Viral or engaging content becomes \"boosted\" with information on why it's boosted, but instead of consuming the feed, it gets injected into the feed at intervals.  The result is the reach creators desire without quieter, less engaging friends' content falling completely off your feed altogether.\n\nThe Constellation\nThe dreaded scrolling is optionally replaced by a visual constellation of \"pulses\".  The Constellation takes shape with each post and the site starts to form an abstract map of connections.  Engaging pulses grow in size and form orbiting \"moons\" with each comment, flipping the script from content being delivered to being explored.  \n\nDo you want to explore the large pulse surrounded by bunches of echoes or check out the lonely blue pulse of sadness that's gone unnoticed? That's entirely up to you and the visualization allows you to really see what content is driving engagement without it being pushed on you...instead it's visually encourages users to gravitate toward it.\n\nThe Canvas\nEvery post adds a brush stroke to your own personal art piece, an abstract canvas of your posts that evolves over time.  Everything in our lives shape who we are, even those long forgotten posts about a sunny day at the park that brought us joy.  The canvas memorializes those moments into a perpetual piece of art you can download and share - like an abstract painting of your life.  (Working on OpenAI integration to turn the basic brush strokes into realistic expressionism, splatter, etc styles but I can't figure it out...yet.)\n\nThe Product\nYou aren't the product on Oura, you're the consumer. Instead of personal data being collected and sold, only enough data is procured to ensure a safe community.  Longevity is provided by way of paid features.  By default, users are limited to one post per hour, encouraging intentionality and thought provoked content, but paid users can post without limit.  Additionally, paid users have access to AI Insights (the type of data that'd be sold to other companies) about themselves based upon their post history.  And eventually, premium users will have access to custom canvas styles and print on demand services to bring their digital canvas to life.\n\nI'm not sure who it'll appeal to but I've had fun building it.  If you want to check it out, it's free to sign up (you can even delete your account in settings) or consider giving it an up vote on: https://www.producthunt.com/products/oura-social?launch=oura-social\n\nAppreciate feedback!",

        "body": "June 12, 2025 Update\n\nOne week later update, I've implemented several new features. \n\nSharing - Users can share posts.  Pretty standard stuff, but I also have a share icon now that can be used on external sites to share content from that site just like Facebook, etc.  Users just copy the embed code from their settings page.\n\nLinks in Posts - Unlike FB, if you add multiple URLs you, they are previewable via a slider instead of it just picking the first.\n\nTagging - Users can now tag other users (with privacy settings).  \n\nAI Insights (Premium Feature) - Users get an AI insight into the community and their personal feed.  Instead of using data to sell stuff, I want to figure out how to use that data to empower people to reflect upon themselves, grow, etc.\n\nBlocking - Standard privacy component.\n\nZooming and Paning - The constellation is now zoomable and can be panned, with optimization via boundary boxes (lazy loading of sorts).\n\nUpcoming - Premium Feature Focus\n\nI don't want to monetize via advertising.  It doesn't fit the site, but I do want it to be self sustaining.\n\nAI canvas.  The basic canvas will be altered into realistic expressionism, splatter, and other art styles using the basic abstract brush strokes as a guide.  I messed around with implementing it, but got myself in a bind and had to restore.\n\nTwin Pulses - A way to connect two pulses that share similar emotional sentiment, that resonate with each other, but that may not be related in anyways.  Trying to connect users across time and space to other users that may resonate with them emotionally, not just shared interests.\n\nConsiderations\n\nI'm leaning away from interest groups.  I hate how my Facebook is just a mess of different for sale groups and misc groups that feel so scattered.  And then there's like 100 different groups for the same thing.  It hurts my brain to see so little structure or consolidation.\n\nI'm also leaning away from direct messaging.  Feels like we already have 25 apps to message people with, we don't need another...I just want to focus on getting the concept of social network right and let other apps focus on selling things, messaging others, playing games, etc.",

    "selftext": "Heard about the site recently on a Diary of a CEO podcast. Decided to have my hand at it to build a personal app for property expense tracking. I haven't coded for 40 years but was employed as a systems analyst back then. I'm not in the biz. I do know how to logically instruct with clarity using proper references. If i were any clearer then I should just code it outright. My entire point in doing this was to see how good natural language programming was today as a way to understand one small element of the future of AI. The passing reference made to the site in the podcast I heard made it seem too good to be true - apparently it was.\n\nStarted off well and made some good progress. Then the errors began. Anything beyond simple design and page linking became error after error. Support from replit is all bot replies. I'd repeatedly get charged for checkpoints that didn't fix errors, being told the error was fixed. Entirely frustrated I walked away a few days after my additional charges hit about 50$ above the monthly. Then I thought let's ask chatgpt to tell me how to fix this. A few clicks and first long frustrating problem gets fixed after I show chatgpt the code. But it's one after another. It's stupid.\n\nThis isn't about my lack of recent coding experience - after all it's meant to be natural language. It's about the agent not being able to find what turn out to be simple errors and charging for a checkpoint despite the failure. Ironically I'd be happy to pay if it worked. This isn't a cost issue, it's a failure issue of the service being offered by the site. There's a word for being charge erroneously, repeatedly, while being told a problem is resolved despite evidence to the contrary.\n\nAt this point I have little trust in the site or code. For those of you in the back row with tons of experience at this what site do you 'trust' to allow me to code via natural language to create an app for an iOS device. Not looking to monetize - this is simply for personal use and interest.\n\nAnd if someone wants to chim in telling me how great the app is, great. I get it. Everyone has a view and experience. Maybe it is. But it's not been my personal experience. And that's all that's relevant to me personally. In hindsight I should have checked out the reddit reviews first.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight on other sites anyone can provide. Thanks",

    "selftext": "I'm really impressed with what you can build when AI tools actually work properly.  \n  \nRecently got super frustrated with Replit AI, Cursor, and Claude getting stuck in loops and giving the same broken solutions repeatedly. Was burning through credits restarting projects constantly.  \n  \nThis sparked the idea to build CodeBreaker - a tool that gives developers proven prompts to reset AI thinking when it gets confused. Instead of restarting your whole coding session, you get specific prompts that actually get the AI back on track.  \n  \nBuilt the whole thing using the AI tools it's designed to fix, which was pretty ironic but worked well once I learned better prompting techniques.   \n  \nReplit Agent is getting way better but you still need to know how to communicate with it properly to avoid the endless debugging loops.   \n  \nFeel free to ask questions about AI prompting strategies, and if you're dealing with stuck AI assistants, check it out.   \n  \nGo save some time and credits guys....hope it helps improve your dev workflow.  \n  \n[code-breaker.org](http://code-breaker.org)",

This made me appear less confident and created an awkward disconnect with my audience, especially during longer presentations where I'd glance down every few seconds.\n\nThe extension keeps your notes visible without breaking that crucial camera eye contact.

        "body": "Based on what you are describing, you’re likely to have some significant issues fixing this for mobile. \n\nFor future reference, it’s common to develop “for mobile first” to avoid these situations, and you can include that qualifier in your initial prompt. Developing for mobile as the priority is preferred as things that display well on mobile usually end up more or less ok on desktop, with a few modifications, but things that are designed for desktop first can be very difficult to get right on mobile. \n\nYou can _try_ to use a blanket “fix this for mobile” prompt, but depending on how complex your application is, that could get messy - and expensive - fast. Especially with calendar views, which are notoriously difficult to do well on mobile without a standard library. \n\nSince you have no coding experience, your best bet is to set replit into mobile preview and use the object selector along with Assistant (and sometimes Agent) to fix each item one by one. \n\n“This element works fine on desktop, however on mobile and tablet views, it renders poorly, leading to a diminished user experience. Please fix this element for mobile and tablet views, ensuring that the desktop view remains unchanged. \n\nI will consider this task a success if the element renders well across all device types without overcomplicating the code or creating unnecessary components”",

    "title": "Do I need an Agent like Replit to create an automation of writing email queries with about 10 tasks?",
    "selftext": "Hi all, I am a complete layman looking to automate the writing of query emails. Do I need something as powerful as replit?\n\nThe general project is like:\n\n\\- identify the best recipients to query based on an overview of my product\n\n\\- write an email in Gmail with two or three sentences that personalize the email based on that recipients history and experience details online\n\n\\- allow me to review and edit the query letters and then send myself\n\n\\- so the AI would need to simply access Google and Gmail, but rather than having to cut and paste from ChatGPT, it would create the emails in Gmail? \n\nIt seems like automating the cutting and pasting wouldn't save that much time and I should just do it myself. **If so, what's the best AI to do this? ChatGPT? Grok? Other?** \n\nAny guidance for this complete novice would be appreciated.",
