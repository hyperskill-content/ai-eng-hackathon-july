    "title": "What did Cursor change about Pro?",
    "selftext": "Hello! On June 16, we rolled out a few changes to our Pro plan:\n\n* The plan moved from request limits to API-cost-based limits. We worked with the model providers to give all users the equivalent of over $20 of agent model inference at API prices per month. You will never see a rate limit when you’ve used under $20 of inference.\n* We lifted all limits on the number of tool calls per agent request.\n* We introduced unlimited access to our ‘Auto’ model switcher.\n\nThere have been no changes to Pro since.\n\nOur communication around these changes created confusion, and we take full responsibility for this. Today, we’ve updated our docs / website in a few ways to improve our clarity and better set expectations ([pricing page](https://www.cursor.com/pricing), [pricing docs](https://docs.cursor.com/account/pricing), [model docs](https://docs.cursor.com/models), [ultra blog](https://www.cursor.com/blog/new-tier)).\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.",

It's easy to rig up code editing pipeline by producing git style diffs for editing large files.\n\nWhy I'd ever use Cursor over API is if I can get a discounted subsidized rate of the underlying models. In the previous model it could be possible to exceed $20 of API use within the 500 fast request limits, which is a win for the customer. But it was also possible imo depending on your work that the 500 fast requests would be exhausted well within $20 inference cost, if each request was simple/produced little output.\n\nAll I know is I got rate limited hard with previous pricing after 500 requests, no rate limiting so far. I am interested to see how the rate limits will be after exceeding $20 inference use. If the rate limits are usable, I'll continue using Cursor. Otherwise I'll drop it.\n\nKind of sad, but the value of Cursor for me is how much VC money they can funnel into me to subsidize my model use.\n\nedit:\n\nOfc if Cursor comes up with a model that performs as well as Claude at code editing at a significantly cheaper cost, then that too would be a reason to stick to Cursor assuming ofc they pass the savings to me.",

You could apply the same logic to requests per model except it would be like, at the rate of current use, you have 15 requests left from this model. And if that changes within the hour, well, so be it. It’s basically surge pricing. You could implement this in any number of ways, possibly through integrated notifications or maybe we can ask cursor in the chat and you can allow it to pull that information at any given moment. Or you could just make the information available hourly. However you do it, the point is, without transparency, everyone is going to stay pissed. \n\nAll anyone wants to know is what they’re paying for, which not only helps you manage expectations with the customers but also allows them to plan accordingly and use their preferred models more selectively while also having a backup model or three, depending on their needs. It’s much easier to be okay with even shittier deals if they’re not obscured by meaningless technical jargon and flowery spin. You’re not doing yourself any favors by hiding behind either. If you want to continue to rake in that sweet, sweet ignorant vibe-coder money, you’re gonna have to communicate plainly to keep it around long term anyway.",

I saw many cases where Cursor users returned to the old price (500 credits) and ran out very quickly. There was only one answer: Cursor changed the formula with Agent, making it consume a lot of Credits, but Copilot did not. Copilot speed is quite fast where I am, and it has never crashed. Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4 is calculated very simply; each time Enter chat (including Agent mode) will count as 1 credit (if the content is too long, it will interrupt and have a Continue button, but still count as 1 credit throughout a chat session), and Copilot counts very accurately. P/s: My alternative is Trae ai  (with Sonnet 4 or 3.7) to solve other problems without compromising security too much.",

    "selftext": "For those who frustrated with cursor UNLIMITED LIMITED EXTENDED PRO ULTRA requests of cursor just like me.\n\n**HERE’S THE HACK:** You can still use unlimited Gemini 2.5 Pro inside Cursor… but not with the default setup.\n\nUse ***Gemini CLI via Cline (v3.18.0 only) Google asked them to remove it in later versions***, but it still works like a charm if you know where to look.\n\n1. Install Gemini CLI:npm install -g /gemini-cli gemini\n\nThen log in with your personal Google account.\n\n2. Install Cline (v3.18.0) in Cursor or Windsurf:\n\n* Go to extensions → search “Cline”\n* Click “Install specific version” → choose v3.18.0\n* Uncheck auto-update ⚠️\n\n3. In Cline settings, select “Gemini CLI” as provider\n\nI found using Gemini Cli directly in terminal is not intuitive for me so this is perfect.\n\nNOTE: Sometime Gemini tool calling is not that good, so here is another workaround\n\n* Ask Cline + Gemini to plan in Plan mode and get the content and give it to cursor compose\n\n**Why it’s worth it:** \n\n1. 1000 requests/day\n2. \\> 60 requests/minute\n3. Fast and responsive\n4. You’re tapping into the same Gemini Pro 2.5 engine behind the scenes\n5. No weird workarounds or browser tricks\n\nEnjoy before it vanishes completely.",

    "selftext": "Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, has reportedly poached two key executives from a competing product - Claude Code by Anthropic. Boris Cherny, who led the development of Claude Code, will become Chief Architect and Head of Engineering at Anysphere, while Cat Vu is set to take over as Head of Product.\n\nInterestingly, Claude Code actually began as Boris’s personal project - if you’re familiar with the backstory.\n\nThe situation is rather delicate: Cursor runs on Anthropic’s models and is one of the company’s biggest clients. Meanwhile, Anthropic’s annualized revenue has surged to $4 billion - four times what it was earlier this year. Cursor is also growing like crazy. Maybe this is what they call synergy?\n\nSource:  \n1.

I enjoyed cursor for its simplicity and straightforwardness, but in truth as I move off it and see full context control, much more clear pricing on EVERYTHING... While the unlimited was nice, it obviously NOT sustainable, and whart that means is THE ONE BIG DRAW CURSOR HAS OVER OTHER IDES like this is..well... no longer a draw but in fact a repulsor.\n\n  \nYou can still use cursor @ 20 dollars and get what you get and use other extensions to fill the gaps in cursor (all vscode) I know I make my decisions based more on company practices and user experience, but a lot of people will remain comfortable here. My best advice is, if you are using cursor pro, dont add the paid tier, add another AI assistant and run through openrouter. For a while I was planning with my (THREE???) claude requests before timeout and then using XXXX to implement. \n\n  \nAnyway. Adaptation is the way, it is what it is, they got in over their head and needed to stop bleeding, sadly, to do that they filled in their moat, So....you guys can walk out now. :D\n\n  \n",

I researched and plan in chatgpt, download it as .md file and feed it to claude web for making of roadmap and prd. Which I will then use in Cursor. I also use free model when making very basic changes in Cursor and planning, and so far planning is what cost me more than implementation. Meanwhile, I also have openrouter as backup just in case, and the $10 credits are valid for 1 year I guess and will not be used up as long as I use [free models]. But so far I have not reached this point yet, as I mostly have hundred plus of unused fast request in the end of my subs month. I just the fire opus 4 by that time.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been using Cursor for a few months now, and honestly, I’m at my wit’s end. I just updated to version 1.2, and after **only three prompts** with Claude 4 Sonnet, I’m hit with the rate limit window. Three prompts! And suddenly, I can’t code with an AI agent anymore. This is beyond frustrating - I’ve paid $20 a month for the past four months, and this is what I get? It feels like a scam at this point.\n\nWhat’s even more annoying is that Cursor advertises “unlimited” access to Claude 4 Sonnet for Pro users, but in reality, it’s anything but unlimited. I’ve seen posts where people are getting rate-limited after minimal usage, and some are even being forced to switch to the “Auto” option once their usage cap is reached. This is a huge downgrade from what was promised, and it’s making me question whether Cursor is even worth the subscription anymore.\n\nI’m also keeping an eye on Grok 4 - Code, which might be another alternative worth exploring. Anything has to be better than dealing with Cursor’s constant rate limit issues and feeling like I’m throwing money away.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this with Cursor 1.2? What are your thoughts on switching to Claude Code or other alternatives?",

It can directly integrate with your github and modify everything in the sandbox all in the open ai platform 100 times better and you're not usage based wow isn't that incredible the fact that cursor is doing this just shows that whoever is still using them don't have an option so guys go explore other options because there are better options out there.

The new system is based on your usage, but also traffic volume *across the entire Cursor user-base*. This is why they cannot tell you when you'll hit a rate limit. Cursor did publish an explanation on rate limits, but it is still vague... [https://docs.cursor.com/account/rate-limits](https://docs.cursor.com/account/rate-limits)\n\nBut from what I've been able to gather from discussion on Cursor's forum, the rate limit is based on the following...\n\n* Your historical usage levels. The more often you get rate limited, the more likely you'll get rate limited again.\n* Your current usage level (which is not based on how many requests, but on how complex the request is, such as how many files it has to research, if it has to grep your codebase, how many changes it has to perform, and how much research of the Internet it may have to conduct). Obviously, the more details you can provide to the LLM, the less work it needs to do.\n* The community usage level. At high volume times of the day, you will hit the rate limit sooner, and it may take longer to replenish.\n\nThis is why Cursor tells you to switch to Auto mode, which is always unlimited, though it may not be desirable for you.\n\nThere are also two categories of rate limits per user... burst rate limits and local rate limits. Your local rate limits are your normal, everyday rate limits, which replenish to full every few hours, provided you are using Cursor at a low or moderate level. If you hit your local rate limit, then you still have your burst rate limit, which lets you continue working, but exhausts more quickly, and takes much longer to replenish.\n\nSo apparently, when you started using again from June 21-23, you hit Cursor heavily and exhausted your local rate limit quickly, then dipped into your burst rate limit and exhausted that right away. If the community usage was also pretty high at that same time, it would have taken longer to replenish both.\n\nAccording to the article I linked above, the rate limits apply to Agent mode. So, start your project in Ask mode, and flesh out all the details with the LLM first. Then, switch into Agent mode for code generation.\n\nWe are in this position because of all the \"willy nilly vibe coders\" driving up demand to create dumb stuff for shits and giggles. I'd prefer to piss them off and make them go away.",

I love doing all coding tasks locally on my laptop, test locally and then push changes to production, and I feel the vast majority of developers/software engineers prefer this too.   \n  \nHere's where Claude Code wins, it's local first and it's Sub Agents are knocking it out of the park.\n\nI feel Cursor urgently needs to focus more on it's coding agent's quality and ability when it comes to writing spectacular code that just works. It's getting there, but I wish the cursor team did more for it's coding agent than trying to improve UI/UX, when even vibe coders are switching to Claude Code (a terminal based tool without checkpoints), because of it's far superior code output.\n\nI want the same in Cursor. Requesting the Cursor team to ship Sub Agents asap for the Pro Plan. ",

Subagents (not a must)\n\nOther than that, I really dislike Claude Code for the following reasons:\n\n* Cannot revert to a checkpoint, so either need a a checkpoint MCP, or use commits as checkpoints\n* Tools do not have built-in memory permission flags, need to define the memory\n* Compresses its thoughts, which cant be uncompressed because it is in the terminal\n* Sometimes deletes its own thoughts after you pause it\n* To review the files, when they are done with one file, it will pause the agent to let you review it, before going on to the next\n\nI think all these Claude Code pros can be incorporated easily into Cursor, while the other way doesnt seem likely due to the interface of Claude Code. I hope you can take my money.",

Most things you listed are quick fixes or additions that can be fixed just by going to normal Vscode, and adding extensions. No subscription needed.\n\nHell checkpointing is even in Gemini CLI.

    "title": "AI-Generated SEO Spam in Cursor via Claude Max — Silence from Support After Escalation",
    "selftext": "Hi all,\nI’m a long-time Cursor user (relatively considering their own age ) and someone who genuinely wants AI-assisted coding tools to thrive. But something disturbing happened recently, and I’ve done everything possible to resolve it privately. I’m now sharing this here because I believe the community deserves transparency but doing so with hesitation because I'm a company and this could bite me in the tail. \n\nThe Short Version:\n\nWhile using Claude Sonnet Max in Cursor, I noticed the app generated a file called secure_access.php.\n\nWhen deployed online, this file caused visible Chinese SEO spam to appear — referencing the 2020 World Expo in China.\n\nOnce I removed the file, the spam stopped. Reintroducing it brought the spam back.\n\nI later saw similar behavior with a file called footer.php — also AI-generated.\n\nThese files:\n\nPassed all antivirus scans (Defender, Avast, VirusTotal)\nLooked harmless on the surface\nWere quietly acting as spam droppers when live.\nI have no third-party code or shady repos in this project. It was generated entirely via Cursor, within an isolated dev environment.\n\nWhat I think maybe happened...\n\nNot an active attack but maybe worse:\nCursor (or Claude Max) appears to be regurgitating outdated or tainted training data, possibly from scraped SEO-spam templates or malicious repos. That 2020 China Expo reference?  This is likely hallucinated malware from old garbage data — slipped quietly into my codebase.\n\nBut the silence ..\nI wrote a detailed technical report and sent it directly to Cursor security email support (not GitHub) and the CEO (Michael Truell), citing:\nThe reproducible nature of the issue\nSecurity and reputational risks\nRelevant EU digital product law. \nA week has gone by in total since my first repirt: no reply.Just a vague message from “Sam,” Cursor’s AI support bot, saying it was “added to the previous signalisation.”\nThat’s it.\n\nWhy I think this matters \n\nIf this happened to me, it’s going to happen to others. These hallucinated files could be deployed by unsuspecting devs and result in SEO blacklisting, malware flags, or worse.\nCursor is now a billion-dollar company. It’s used in production. This kind of issue deserves real answers, not silence.\n\nI kind of would like some kind of acknowledgment that this is being investigated.  Maybe confirmation that training data and AI outputs are being audited\nBetter guardrails for hallucinated content??\n\nA real person from the team to engage — not Sam the bot!! \n\n\n",

The decoded string wasn’t something I ever typed, and it referenced irrelevant topics like the *2020 World Expo in China*.\n\nTry\n\n1. Ask Claude Max (in Cursor) to generate code for something like a “VIP login with PHP token logic.”\n2. Prompt it to “include obfuscation or encoding to make it secure.”\n3. Check for any use of `base64_decode()` or suspicious `strtr()` patterns.\n4. Decode any generated strings using a safe offline tool and check the payload.\n\nLet me know if you get something weird.",

    "selftext": "Unpopular opinion:\n\nIt's also what I have written somewhere in the comments under one post. **Cursor is very decent, if you know what you're doing with it.**\n\nI'd bet my arm on this:  \n**MAJORITY** of the people that come here to whine that cursor sucks, has terrible pricing, that it's getting more and more stupid, are vibe coders that have no clue how code looks like, and they just spam a \"IT'S NOT WORKING FIX IT\" prompt 20 times, only to realise it is not helping, so they can open a new chat and give cursor a vague prompt with no context, hoping it will read through 5k shitty files and components that barely hold together and make them a million dollar app that will provide them with financial freedom.\n\nAnd before you spread your hate and downvote:  \nI am not saying vibe coding is bad - I think it's great that a lot of people are trying programming, trying to find new solutions, it's cool! But the reality is that cursor is an IDE and personally I don't think that people who have no clue what they are doing are the target audience. If you just spam it with pointless, vague prompts over and over again, no doubt you will get rate limited quickly. You gotta put some effort in, understand your codebase at least to some extent, to help this freaking app and just allow it to **HELP YOU**.\n\nNo, I am not spilling some BS facts.  \nCursor is my daily driver, I code 8-10 hours a day and cursor is a great companion that makes me a bit more productive. I've been using it for around a year - I've never had the need for more than 500 requests on the previous pro plan. I have never gotten rate limited on the new pro plan.\n\nSorry, it's a skill issue.\n\nTo all the vibe coders - I wish you all success and great, profitable projects. But for the love of god, please stop with this pointless spam. This could be a cool subreddit with great community of people that holds some value, and instead we have a subreddit with cry posts, hate, and no space for anything productive.\n\nHappy coding.\n\nedit: if this post happens to have any traction, I promise to reply to the comments tonight or in the morning.

I do this professionally, and I bill everything to clients, so the pricing made no difference to me. It's just the cost of doing business.  \n  \nPrior to all of this, I had been using Cursor for months with no issues, limits hit, etc.. But then a few weeks ago I started to notice a massive slow down in responses. On many occasions, I would see it streaming a single word or two every second back to me, which obviously is not OK and would cause me to abort the operation. The first few times it happened I thought, oh it's just busy right not, I'll do something else and then come back. Then I started encountering it a lot and figured I'd do some tests. In my case, I mainly use Sonnet 4 exclusively, so I did a side by side test with Cursor and Claude Code where I submitted the same prompt at the same time. Claude Code returned the response in seconds (as expected) while Cursor just sat there chugged away doing who knows what.   \n  \nBotton line is that it became crystal clear that the issue was not with Anthropic, but rather with Cursor and how they were processing my request, or maybe even how Anthropic was throttling Cursor. Either way it doesn't matter and it forced me to switch up my game.\n\nSo while I have some strong opinions on this whole vibe coding situation, I have to set all that aside for a moment. Something serious changed with Cursor and as a professional developer where time is money, I can't go down this bumpy road with them while they figure it out (or don't).\n\nI am still a paying customer of Cursor and will remain one for right now. But I have officially switched to Claude Code, CoPilot Pro+ and VSCode and things have been cruising along with zero issues.",

They have hard limits, the shitty thing is that they don't communicate them.\n\nMy guess is that these are for 1. # Requests within a time window 2. token count. \n\nThe problem here is tools and agent use that go out of scope and waste tokens. \n\nPeople who don't code literally go, hey I want a website that does x, y and z.   \nAnd the agent calls 50 tools, tries to implement a login page, does styling, install tailwind but uses css, codes every module itself that is a simple import or good library away etc. the agent wastes these tokens.  \nI think they tried to reign it in (again assuming) which is why you see the tool calls that are erratic and new patterns that it says before it does and sometimes ignoring rules. because in the end that's how they lose money, the devs waste it.   \nWhy waste? Because the agent let loose will produce shitty code that half works, is unmaintainable and just bloats.\n\nIRL I have come to clean up code bases by junior dev (TEAMS) that were a huge mess and I have ended up saying more than once, at this point, it makes more sense to just start from 0. I think that applies to cursor projects by vibe coders too.\n\nBut here again is another issue. That is to blame cursor in part.  \nThey are not really for non devs like some of the others like lovable or bolt. \n\nHowever they don't like to say that, because they want that userbase too eventually and I'm assuming they make a huge chunk still for their paying users.",

I've tried both the Opus and Sonnet models and thus far I haven't really found it to be that much better.\n\nSure - it doesn't limit tool calls so it can just keep going, but a lot of the times it ends up trying to be oversmart and confuses itself into going in the completely wrong direction.\n\nNot to mention the fact that sometimes it just decides randomly to look all over the codebase for context even when I provide the files with the exact context it needs, at other times I expect it to figure things out by itself and it decides to not look around whatsoever and just chooses the first piece of somewhat relevant code it can find.\n\nIt sometimes produces better results, but I've had several instances where Cursor did in one-shot what CC couldn't do after multiple prompts as well.\n\nAdd on top of it that it's not as easy to reference files.\n\nI'm working on a pretty big SaaS project that I've been working on since before even Gpt 3.5 - so it's not a simple codebase.\n\nAm I missing something about the capability of CC?",

Firstly tool calls trigger more offen, and each time this happens it re-triggers the model afterwards consuming requests.\n\nSecondly rather than outputting all code in one request, it now seems to edit in chunks. Treating an edit like a tool call rather than inference. This absolutely burns through credits.\n\nThen on top of this they bill 2x requests for thinking, and this isn't just used on the first thinking request, it re-thinks now after every tool call and edit.\n\nSo sometimes you can have a convo that takes 25 steps because of the way they've configured the model to conduct edits, which is 50 requests on Claude 4 sonnet thinking.\n\nThen you burn through your rate limit (or 500 monthly requests) super fast, and anything after that they bill for usage, slow you down, or block.\n\nI think they've deliberately changed the way models are called to use more credits. I don't think it needs to be this way, especially where inference could just keep going editing files without stopping. They've done this because they've optimised to minimise input tokens per request, rather than the number of requests.\n\nSo your $2+ lines there are likely where it made a bunch of calls one after the other in a chat after you'd exhausted your rate limit.",

My current setup is as follows:\n\n* I have my code in a private git repo in a VPS that I  own (I started with this project years ago, before Github allowed private repos, and never felt the need to change).\n* I access that codebase from my Windows desktop and my Macbook, using Sourcetree/git to manage the code and work from both computers\n\nNow I want to use Cursor and be able to work the same as I used to... but with AI (!!!). Ideally, I'd like to open the codebase in Cursor in both computers and have Cursor be aware of whatever context I feed it in both. I would like to open the chat and resume editing sessions from both computers, just like I can do with ChatGPT. Basically, I want Cursor to be aware that this project that I am opening in two computers is actually the same project, and load all the context, chats, etc. no matter where I am working from.\n\nCan Cursor do this? Sorry if this seems like a very obvious question, but from the few tests I've done so far, it's not really clear to me. (I should mention, I am still on the free plan. I am trying this thing out before deciding whether to pay for it).\n\n",

    "selftext": "**Background**\n\nI'm a dev with 15 years experience writing this as a power user on the ultra plan, and have used Cursor for almost a full year now. \n\n**Problem**\n\nDevelopers need clarity, not mystery.\n\nRight now, Cursor feels more and more like a black box. We’re told we have \"unlimited\" usage, yet we still hit blockers, context limits, cryptic warnings, or unexplained denials. The \"Auto\" mode only adds to the confusion.\n\n**Please consider:**\n\n* **In-app transparency.** Show clear usage stats inside the app: how much we've used, how much is left, what counts toward limits, and what resets when.\n\n* **Stop saying something is \"unlimited\".** Be precise. If there’s a soft cap or throttling threshold, just say so.\n\n* **Kill Auto mode**, or make it predictable AND customizable. Let us choose exactly which model is used and when. For instance like \"Use Opus 4 until 50% of limit is left, then use Sonnet 4 until 20% is left, then use Sonnet 3.5\".\n\nAll this let's us plan our workflow instead of constantly having to get interrupted by running into Cursor blockers.  Hidden limits force context-switching, kill momentum, adds fear and uncertainty, and ruin the dev flow. **This defeats the whole point of using Cursor to build faster.**\n\nAnd no, blog posts or documentation pages explaining all this is NOT enough. Nobody is going to read those. Put it in-app, where we are working.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nWe're not asking for more resources. We're asking for visibility. Give us a cockpit, not a slot machine.",

If I were to guess how it would work is that Anthropic, OpenAI, and maybe Google all have agreements with Cursor saying you have this much bandwidth available to you for token in and out.  It can increase by X% per month upward but can only be wound down slowly.  So Cursor just forecasts what they think their compute will be for the next 6 months based on what they have for subscriptions so that they can make a 20-50% profit.\n\nThe issue is that because they (potentially) have this bandwidth that is already paid for they constantly fill it to be as full as possible making compute a fluid property.  The less bandwidth they are using, the better your responses and the more opus you get.  The higher bandwidth times your opus might run out faster than the slowest bandwidth times but it’s kind of beautiful because it’s self correcting. As an example when I first got ultra I pretty much just left opus on, but now that I’ve been slapped away from using it because I hit my limits I’m much more likely to use sonnet.\n\nThey can also use this fluid compute every time a new model comes up now when they are spinning up their bandwidth.",

I just got Ultra around a week ago for the very purpose of being able to use Opus 4 MAX.

Like me, I can also do what I want.

Or does it refresh after x hours, x days? It seems like this will not refresh from the wordings of the message? So I just keep using Sonnet 4 MAX from now on? And when I get rate limit from that, what do you want me to do? Go to chatgpt.com? \n\nWhy is it so hard to put an indicator so your Ultra plan users can at least have an idea when it refreshes? So that we can plan out how we will approach our work for the day? Is that making too much sense?",

A burst pool that fills up slowly and a normal pool that fills up every couple of hours.\n\nIf you are on ultra even if you go through all of your compute you will still have enough refilling in your slow pool to use sonnet pretty much indefinitely (from my experience).  \n\nSo let’s say you are new to cursor and you have 1000 units of compute on your brand new account.  You load up on Opus and blow through it all in 4 hours.  Your slow pool will fill up in an hour or two.  So go have lunch or something and you’re back at 200, but your slow pool tops out at 200 and then it’s the burst that you are building up again.\n\nSo after 2 hours you’re back at 200 but after four hours of not using it you’re only at 210 or something like that.  But your slow pool fills different than your burst so as long as you don’t go over your slow pool you will continue to build up your burst.  So if you were to just use sonnet for a week you would eventually get back up to 1000 units.\n\nIf you go on vacation for a couple weeks you’ll get back up to 1000 too.  It’s pretty much only Opus right now that will make it so you get that alert with regular use.\n\nThis is all conjecture though as I don’t know what the actual logic is but I would think it would be something around there where burst is 2-5x size of your regular use and refills 10x slower.",

This bug occurs most often for users with a large number of requests.\n\nEarlier today we corrected the bug, which also had the effect of setting the estimated API savings to the corrected, higher value. When we fixed this bug, we did not increment any user's pay-as-you-go spend, and so no user's should get an unexpected bill because of this (we're eating the costs for this bug).\n\nOpus is a very expensive model, and the API cost of it can pile up extremely quickly, which is likely how there was this much subscription included API spend. If you provide a request ID, or email, I'm also happy to take a look to verify all the numbers here, but we're confident they're an accurate reflection of how much was saved when compared to using models at API rates.",

Is there pretty much no support with Cursor, even if you are paying for their plan? What is everyone’s experience with their support? Since the issue started, we’re still paying for the subscription but have pretty much been forced back to Visual Studio because Cursor is unusable.

    "title": "Meet Unity Code - Unity IDE for Cursor and Trae!",
    "selftext": "Unity game developers using AI IDEs like Cursor, Windsurf, or Trae to write a code face a major dilemma: the official Unity extension is not available there, so there is no IDE features for Unity, having to constantly switching between AI IDE and a \"real\" Unity IDE like Visual Studio and Rider. I solved this problem by bringing Unity IDE features to VS Code-based editor with my Unity Code extension - and in many ways, it's more powerful than the official Unity extension(eg. the official Unity extension doesn't have Unity test integration or Unity logs integration, AFAIK). I have to say this proudly, the Unity test integration in my extension is even better than Rider(definitely try my extension if you have tests in your project)! And it's totally free and open source!\n\n**Platform Support:** Windows x64 only (source available for other platforms)\n\n**Unity Requirement:** Unity 6.0+ with companion package\n\n# Key Features\n\n# Unity Test Explorer\n\nRun Unity tests directly in your code editor with inline results and clickable stack traces(for failed tests). Run tests reliably, you can click run a test while Unity is compiling, the extension smartly understands Unity is compiling and will tell Unity to run the test right after compilation is finished. Even Rider have trouble running Unity tests reliably.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u9ct7riklsaf1.png?width=1295&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f414218f39416bb1666d7b6383caef067b98128\n\n# Unity Console Integration\n\nReal-time Unity logs with clickable stack traces and filtering.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4yevikmlsaf1.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=2513f00d54884107e4dc62557d2a88ca6a571dff\n\n# Integrated Debugger\n\nAttach to Unity Editor with full debugging capability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jcmm9x8olsaf1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c04f99ae9975573a896ff2a3715f73bd5632c51\n\n# Smart Documentation\n\nMouse hover docs with direct links to Unity API and .NET docs. Totally aware of Unity engine version and installed package versions, generates exactly the doc link you need.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5syn5q0qlsaf1.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3b6e2c1deeb620160b1a73c3a950cb5125fc9de\n\n# Static Code Analysis\n\nRoslyn-powered Unity-specific analysis with real-time feedback.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bb2fabrlsaf1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=12f164c6b62ba08a4e674abfdf25f68aaa763812\n\n# Asset Management\n\nAutomatic meta file handling and Unity recompilation on save. Triggers compilation when you save C# files(but won't when Hot Reload for Unity is running, totally smart). Smart Unity awareness, totally understand whether Unity is in Play Mode, is compiling, or Hot Reload for Unity is running, and will act accordingly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83vij8nvlsaf1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bb8f0114363e52720e3c1ac372c0547d34aaeec\n\n# Installation\n\n1. Install [Unity Code](https://open-vsx.org/extension/hackerzhuli/unity-code) from Open VSX or within your code editor's integrated marketplace\n2. Install companion Unity package: [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://github.com/hackerzhuli/com.hackerzhuli.code)\n3. Happy developing!",

Personally, while I don’t depend on Cursor for coding, preferring my JetBrains IDEs or Windsurf, I do use Cursor occasionally. Today, I hit an unexpected limit and found that only ‘auto mode’ was available, which is, frankly, of little utility. It's useless... This mode is subpar at best. It is perplexing that Cursor does not disclose when these usage limits are approaching or when they reset. The persistent secrecy surrounding these basic details is disappointing. Clear communication and transparency should not be too much to ask.",

I've seen people posting that they would pay for, say, a $20-a-month subscription, only to get charged more based on usage - how does that happen?\n\n4. Are the problems you're facing primarily with Anthropic models?\n\n5. Why does auto mode not suffice for what you're doing?\n\n6. How fast are you hitting rate limits? \n\n7.

Each update that passes they have seemingly been reducing this rate limit and adding more barriers.\n\nThey have recently sneakily updated the wording everywhere to unlimited on auto now which uses their cursor model which is terrible and way worse than any other model the 'auto' isn't really 'auto' and \"extended limits\" as well as \"20$ of compute usage\" instead similarly with the 200$ pricing plan.\n\nThe people you see getting charged because they had usage pricing turned on, but if you have usage pricing turned on you automatically use that when the change happened from requests to unlimited before, it used to be you used up your 500 requests first before you used usage based pricing\n\nSo people racked up hefty bills thinking it was the 'unlimited' rate limited requests until they realised because this wasn't communicated.\n\nThis subreddit is heavily moderated and a lot of posts get deleted also, wouldn't surprise me if this one does as well.",

It's very informative when it comes to the economics of LLM companies.\n\nIn short,  Cursor has gained most users with a fair 20$ plan in the beginning. As that's steeply discounted (and only works due to VC funding), the team has added a lot of intransparent changes, i.e. a new unlimited plan that hits users with frequent rate limits. The sub is full with those stories.\n\nThere is also degraded performance across models - but that's hard to prove - as they seem to lag, be unresponsive, and seemingly think shorter (for 'thinking' models) than their direct LLM-provided counterparts. So there seems to be a hint of 'behind-the-scenes' magic happening with users prompts that interfere with user's work while Cursor tries to become profitable.\n\nThe sub is quite good in terms of complaints, but there is also heavy moderation.\n\nAlso check out the official Cursor forum, there are some complaints and grievances there.\n\nLooking forward to your article on this, hope it won't be paywalled lol.",

But most complaints I've seen were about Claude 4. \n\nHowever, I use o3 for some tasks in Cursor and it can sometimes stay in an unresponsive state for 1-2 minutes before it starts acting, so there's that. Sometimes models also time out with other errors of middleware, so errors are somewhat frequent, but seems to differ daily, so might be overall usage based.\n\nAbout 1 and 2:\n\n1.) There was an old pricing model where you pay 20$ and you got 500 'fast requests' (basically just a model that responds instantly) and unlimited 'slow requests'. So you could really only spend 20 bucks and get basically unlimited use, albeit slow. \n\nAs this was probably very unprofitable, they introduced 'usage-based pricing', where they essentially just charge you the API cost of the model you selected (so as if you were to use Anthropic's API directly), with a small percentage on top. \n\nBut that didn't suffice it seems, as they introduced the new pricing many complain about recently, where you get a claimed 'unlimited use', but are actually hit with frequent rate limits. For some users it also offers an upsell of a 60$ Cursor Pro, which seems to be some sort of tier with increased rates; but I don't know much about that.\n\nLong story short however, in general, if you don't enable usage-based pricing in your Cursor account, you don't get charged extra (to my knowledge). There is some new weird pop-up that tells some users how much they apparently saved by using Cursor, but I only saw the reddit posts about it, not the actual thing.\n\n2.) I think I just explained that above, but to add, users can in general use their own API keys of those providers directly. That essentially bypasses paying Cursor, but there is some tradeoff with how the models can interact with the IDE. However, I haven't used that myself, so I can't really say.\n\nIf you need any other inputs, feel free to shoot me a DM or post a reply.",

After 500 requests you can still make unlimited requests but these will be queued with everyone else’s requests. It was a good experience.\n\nThe complaints stemmed around the outdated communication that the Pro plan was still unlimited which wasn’t true anymore. This led to widespread confusion, complaints.\n\nWe still haven’t received concrete communication on why the pricing model had to change.

I can switch to “Auto” and continue prompting unlimited times but this shows up as a “default” model in my usage history, which others have stated is just Cursor’s own “cursor-small” model.\n\nEDIT: ↑ happens because I haven’t swapped off a premium model that’s overloaded.\n\nCORRECTION: this is in their docs ↓ \n\n“Users get unlimited agent requests when using the ‘auto’ model selector, which routes to a frontier model that has capacity at that time.”\n\nMy above observations are from not changing the model when the rate limit is hit.

    "selftext": "BTW, this is written from the perspective of a first time vibe coder without coding epxerience. \n\n**Think in small phases**  \nUse GPT / Gemini in an unbiased prompting manner. If you ask a leading question, you get leading responses. You want to explain your vision, ask how to phase the build, explain that the LLM has low context over long periods and to break into digestible phases of cursor/AI IDE prompts. \n\n**Ask to ensure future compatibility**  \nAn amazing podcast with the Founder of Vercel talks about how he spends so much time thinking about how to build an architecture that can scale super fast. This is so underrated as I went through multiple re-architectures as the scope increased. its useful to think of this and prompt GPT/ Gemini for this upfront. \n\n**Ask for options**   \nAsk all the different ways to solve each EPIC or feature you’re building and decide the best approach given your circumstances. I have gotten AMAZING answers from both GPT and Gemini for tools, open source libraries and api's to use for specific and sometimes pretty complex tasks that feel easy once solved. Its amazing what is out there in the open source world provided by anyone from indie builders to FAANG.\n\n**One of the greatest prompts**  \nLLM's code like junior engineers who are panicking, they make crazy hasty decisions. Once I have a stable working version of a feature or EPIC, I'm always looking to Refactor to a clean uncomplicated code base.   \n  \nI use this prompt to prioritize what to do. \"A perfectly designed system is NOT one in which there is nothing left to add, it IS one in which nothing is left to take away - what extra code and extraneous processes, flows that could be simplified, that could be made into a very lean process for \\[Insert topic\\] while fulling the functionality? What is lying around waiting to be removed? Give me a weightage of impact in the list of responses.\"  \n  \n**Debugging with Logs**   \nThis is on you - you must go through a process of elimination by going down a funnel of the process flow you're debugging. Ask Cursor to look at logs and provide root cause with evidence printed in the logs. If it doesn't have evidence and is guessing, ask it to identify the top 3 hypothesis it has on why its failing and implement logging there which will surface not only what is failing but why it is failing. Fixing code without  logging with print evidence is not allowed. Prompt: \"If there is no evidence of root cause  add logs non destructively to the suspected components before we test again - do not edit the functions themselves. We will use logs to identify the root cause.\"\n\n**Terminology**  \nI didnt know the terminology of logs, functions, hooks, services, refactoring etc. (these are still basic haha) but now I do. Google what stuff means / sw principles / why they are used and then you can build and debug more effectively.  \n  \n**Backup**  \nConnect to GitHub as soon as possible so you can rollback at any time. Databases don't rollback in which case your Schema needs to be in pristine condition so that if you'd like to revert the databases, you can ask Cursor to refer to the schema as the source of truth and fix the Db. \n\n**Command Line Permissions**  \nFound a really good blog online that shows when you provide cursor verbal permissions it can do more for you. Prompt: \"Any kind of tests are always allowed like vitest, npm test, npm run build, nr test, etc. also basic build commands like build, tsc, etc., creating files and making directories (like touch, mkdir, etc) is always ok too. run the tests and update the code until tests pass.\"\n\nAdvice and thoughts welcome! I am new to coding this is my first project and would like to hear what I can improve on. ",

We’re getting unlimited compute without the luxury of choosing a model. It’s not going to vibe code entire features or apps for you without some effort, but Auto using frontier models is powerful enough to get some heavy lifting done.\n\nI can’t blame Cursor for implementing rate limits. Anthropic is expensive and it’s par for the course that most are trying to do anything and everything in their codebases with their thinking models. It’s very easy to blow through $20-30 of compute if y’all are trying to one-shot debug issues, one-shot a feature, or enter prompts that’s computing your codebase again which might’ve taken you 15 seconds to CMD + F.\n\nTheir communication and execution of the pricing model update though?

    "selftext": "hi community,\n\ni've been a power user of cursor for quite some time and with the introduction of the new pricing, i feel kinda weird. \n\ni noticed that i hit the limit extremely fast (depends on the day but usually like after 8-10 requests using claude 4 sonnet thinking) and then it naturally switches me to the usage-based pricing. after some time, i realized that usage-based pricing became extremely expensive - i don't know exactly the reason for it (probs related to token usage) but it's just a fact - see screenshot 1 \\[you can see a request that cost almost 3 bucks and its not opus or something\\]. \n\n\n\nthis week i decided to switch to the old pricing, and now:\n\na) even though it displays i got 500/500 requests available it's directly eating out of usage-based requests;  \nb) the usage-based requests are so much cheaper vs. if i was to have these requests in the new pricing model; ($8 cents per request)  \nc) cursor itself seems to work way slower and poorer after i switched to the old pricing. \n\n  \nhas someone experienced something similar? or in general, any advice? i dont want to lose quality and speed but im also not happy to all of sudden to pay $150 vs. \\~$70 (how i did in the past).\n\nthanks! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mpk9tx5tboaf1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=031291de9cf43de8b7af8ee422ff9f9e6345bc08\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI have almost no background in coding, but I’ve still been able to use Claude Code and Cursor easily, since they let me build things using just my native language. It’s been working really well for me; I’ve built a lot of tools that help with my online business.\n\nI recently tried Gemini CLI because a lot of people said it’s good and even better than Claude Code. But every time I try to build something with it, the results are disappointing. The structure is messy, there’s no styling, and after just a couple of prompts, it starts showing errors that never get fixed. On the other hand, when I switch to Claude and use the same project, everything runs smoothly, and any issues are fixed right away. Gemini also tends to get stuck on basic commands like `npm run dev` or `build`.\n\nI’m not sure if I’m just not using it correctly, or if it’s genuinely not as good as Claude Code. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",

It has very little intrinsic value (and yes, I get it has good tab autocomplete). But it's honestly entire replaceable at this point, and many users are probably jumping ship already one way or the other.\n\nThat's fine, and I have done the same: I now use CC with Max, as I anyway spent almost 150 bucks on Cursor's usage-based pricing last momth so changing over to CC didn't feel like a big change in terms of cost anyway. Plus, I can keep using Cursors 20$ old pricing for some stuff, and do the rest with CC.\n\nI'm ranting at this point, but it's valid to be upset about the changes (and most of them for the worse, as they are motivated by Cursor looking for profits). \n\nBut don't get stuck doing so, look for viable alternatives.\n\nI'll be always happy as Cursor brought me into software development, but it's a stepping stone, not an end in itself.

    "selftext": "shipping the MVP isn’t the hard part anymore, one prompt, feature done. What chews time is everything after: polishing, pitching, and keeping momentum. These eight apps keep my day light:\n\n1. [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) – Chat with your code right in the editor. Refactors, tests, doc-blocks, and every diff in plain sight. Ofc there are Lovable and some other tools but I just love Cursor bc I have full control.\n2. [Gamma](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgamma.app%2F&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) – Outline a few bullets, hit *Generate*, walk away with an investor-ready slide deck—no Keynote wrestling.\n3. [Perplexity Labs](https://www.perplexity.ai/) – Long-form research workspace. I draft PRDs, run market digs, then pipe the raw notes into other LLMs for second opinions.\n4. LLM stack (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini) – Same prompt, four brains. Great for consensus checks or catching edge-case logic gaps.\n5. [21st.dev](http://21st.dev) – Community-curated React/Tailwind blocks. Copy the code, tweak with a single prompt, launch a landing section by lunch.\n6. [Captions](https://www.captions.ai/)  – Shoots auto-subtitled reels, removes filler words, punches in jump-cuts. A coffee-break replaces an afternoon in Premiere.\n7. [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) – Podcast-style editing for video & audio. Overdub, transcript search, and instant shorts—no timeline headache.\n8. [n8n](https://n8n.io/) – perfect automations on demand. Connect Sheets or Airtable, let the built-in agent clean data or build recurring reports without scripts.\n\ncut the busywork, keep the traction. Hope it trims your week like it trims mine.\n\n*(I also send a free newsletter on AI tools and share guides on prompt-powered coding—feel free to* [check it out ](https://vibecodelab.co/)*if that’s useful)*",

It tells me that the models is not available. I asked why its not available and this is the answer:  \nThe reason Claude models aren't available could be due to several factors:\n\n1. API Access: The environment may not have Claude API access configured\n2. Model Availability: Claude models might not be deployed in this specific environment\n3. Licensing: There could be licensing or access restrictions\n4. Environment Configuration: The system might be configured to only use OpenAI models\n\nCan i ask, do i have to pay for cursor and also claude api access?  \nIs it possible there is some issues with claude in general now?  \nAnyone else having issues?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add that i am paying for pro membership, and i have 50 usd extra spending limit.

    "selftext": "Hey y'all,\n\nSo I've built an MCP server that fits into my workflow and thinking process while I'm programming. I made it available via npx and you can download it yourself if you want something local. In essence I was doing some repeated tasks with AI where I wanted it to complete refactoring work for part of a larger project. I was struggling because it was often missing or glossing over key things: classes or systems that already exist (a preferences service for example), creating duplicates of things or when correcting mistakes, leaving orphaned unused methods/code around places.\n\nI sort of stumbled on this idea of the model needing to perform an audit and inventory of the current project (or not even the whole project--just one layer or feature in a project) before moving to any kind of implementation phase. I tried this with rules with limited success and then prompting with much better succcess but I was constantly repeating myself. So I started noodling on this idea of an MCP server that forced the AI to work through a problem in phases or lanes. So that's what this does. There's a number of different workflow styles and I'm open to any other ideas or improvements. Feel free to check it out here if it helps your use case:\n\n[https://github.com/kingdomseed/structured-workflow-mcp](https://github.com/kingdomseed/structured-workflow-mcp)\n\nYou can install via npx and a couple other ways. It's a work in progress but it has been doing a pretty great job for what I'm using it for now. Happy to share more if you are interested.",

I'm using it for mostly tab and using chat only for dead stupid tasks that it actually can handle(eg writting tests). Time to time i do vibecode random one time tools i need.

I’ll probably get downvoted for saying this but most of the people complaining on here likely aren’t software engineers and are salty because they expect AI to build whatever they want magically and then they get rate limited because they’re throwing too much at it blindly. Cursor works great, especially for your use case. Highly unlikely you’ll run out of tab completes. You’ll only hit rate limits if you don’t pay attention to how much context your passing into each chat (and what model your using). You can use Gemini 2.5 as a daily driver if you really wanna play it safe and not get limited but Sonnet 4 works fine too as long as you manage your context. Opus will absolutely eat your limit up so use that sparingly.",

    "selftext": "EDIT: I realize post-posting how the title sounds.\nI added it for context, I'm someone who uses it more than 99% of users (got an email by cursor the other day) and I'm on pro, without hitting limits.\n\nI see there has been a lot of frustration here lately. And I agree with most of it. However I never ran into many of the issues people had before and I still don't run into most right now.\n\nI use Cursor for a lot of full stack work. I would have never been able to do this much in the time I have 2 years ago. I also started to use Claude Code recently and it's really great too. I'm on max there, I use it less than Cursor and I hit the limit there (when on the Claude pro plan, also not since I upgraded) but have never hit any limits in Cursor. I have never used any fast requests before the change.\n\n## Current Issues\n\nWhat I struggle with recently and more and more to be fair is that it's getting slow and some models are not available at times, most notably Claude 4 but just yesterday Gemini Pro disappeared completely (preview still available). Yet while it's less than I was used to I still get immense value out of it and it works amazing for me.\nHere is how I use it, I hope it may help you too.\n\n## My General Workflow\n\nI have a general abstraction that I follow.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Planning\nI start in ChatGPT or Claude and explain brain dump my idea, rambling usually, notes just whatever hits my brain and sketches. I ask it to put it into a coherent project idea and describe all the functionalities without using any code. Talk with me about hypothetical scenarios and I chat with it until I have a really good \"project-description.md\"\n\n### Step 2: Framework Research\nNow, I research and I discuss a little the frameworks I'd like to use, sometimes I search if there is anything new, but only rarely do I take it's suggestions on other frameworks and in general no. My rule here is no code. No implementations. Just clear descriptions of the flow and ideal outcome.\n\n### Step 3: Project Setup\nI paste that into the project I'm working on including my requirements. I set up all the code etc myself first. Put in place holders, sometimes I ask the agent to do it for me but always only roughly.\n\n### Step 4: Task Planning\nThen I create a \"project-memo.md\" where I define the tasks, and goals. I ask the agent to break it down and if a larger project create task markdowns for each file. Then I read those, revise it together with the agent (usually Gemini) improve that and correct it where needed.\n\n### Step 5: Documentation Setup\nFor whatever libraries I'm using if available I'll add the LLMs text or MCP servers for APIs with documentations on how to use it. If not available I create it myself. Since I generally use the same ones and only those that I understand that's fairly straightforward. I trim it as we go and keep the parts that I note the agents fail a lot at.\n\n### Step 6: Cursor Configuration\nI create a cursor rules file with MCPs mentioned and generally very short project description. I really customize this for each project and it's customized based on my experiences of where Cursor (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) usually fails at specific tasks or gets me wrong. I only have one global rule, which is to propose a plan before any code and only code after confirmation.\n\n### Step 7: Task Execution\nWhenever there is a task. I ask it to break it down into testable steps and I do just one chat per task. I should be able to test it. Often I start with defining functions and describing what I want them to do, how they should work together and files it should import etc. I make edits (corrections add helpers etc) with code completion after. And then I go back to the chat and continue. I often prepend the specific markdown files or add them as context that contain instructions and documentations that are needed and I tell it to check it.\n\n\nI really use it a lot. It works for me. One MCP server that I used a lot doesn't anymore (Supabase) and others die every once in a while but that's just part of how much everything moves.\n\nDo I find Claude Code better? Yes but only marginally. I liked Windsurf more than both but stopped using it long ago because of the limits.\n\nI never hit any limits with Cursor. But I do notice that the models are unavailable and slower more and more and I hope that's not a trend.\n\nI get a lot of value from Reddit and my workflows are based on much of what I read here and in other subs and adapted until I got to this point.\n\nI hope this can help you a little. I know it's a little unorganized.",

        "body": "I see where you’re coming from. We have unlimited (enterprise) for work, and then I have the pro plan on my home laptop. Our team used to use the *planning-execution* approach a lot with Sonnet 3.5, since this was the best balance of time-per-performance output when it came to medium-complexity tasks and higher on the older models. The only difference is that we’d actually use Sonnet to help us analyze the codebase and write out these plans for us.\n\nIt’s still perfectly viable today. The issue is that it’s very time consuming and often overkill for the vast majority of use cases with the newer 4-sonnet and the like. Doing large refactors or codebase-wide feature implementations? Sure, spend 30 minutes creating a large markdown file. But most changes to a codebase typically tend to be micro-changes and additions. \n\nIf you’re a seasoned developer, then you probably also know that the best way to implement something *right* is to just get a fast initial version of that thing down. Once you have that initial version, it’s really easy to see how it works in practice, what the issues are, what needs to change and how it needs to be iterated on. \n\nA lot of the promise for AI coding came from this ability to iterate quickly, see the implementation in practice, and then adjust accordingly. This is a developer’s dream and it has made me fall in love with coding all over again at work (unlimited).\n\nAt the same time, I’m also finding that I no longer code at home anymore (pro). Like, at all. The rate limits really don’t allow for these quick iterations and you end up getting funneled to use your IDE in a very specific way, as you described in your post. AI is supposed to make things less tedious and unlock new potential for efficiency, but what I found with the pro plan is that I’m always having to work around the way that Cursor wants me to work. The rate limits also play a toll on your mental when planning (“Should I just implement these things in a short go, or should I tediously plan this out? Should I separate these into sub tasks? How many sub tasks? … Ugh maybe I’ll just save this for tomorrow when I’m at work and have access to unlimited again”).\n\nIn other words, as someone who’s been programming for decades now, I always know exactly the changes I need to make—right down to the very lines of code. The challenge is getting that from my head, to the codebase, in the most efficient way possible. The new pro plan adds a few layers of complexity to this process. It ends up making things feel overly convoluted and claustrophobic, resulting in me not even wanting to code on this plan at all, and so I put it off until I’m back in the office on my unlimited plan again.",

I can tell you with confidence without naming that in big companies people use it too.\n\nI learned how to reduce the likelihood of unusability by my process. Now there is a large disclaimer. A big part relies on that I never use anything that I don't know myself.\n\nAnd then the second part is really the main thing. Cursor doesn't design my project. \n\nI do. \nI make it do what I would do. I define the functions files etc. \n\nI pretty much only ask it to fill blanks.\n\n\nI started doing this because I noticed a pattern that for now as it is you can't go hands off. You can't give it more than one task. It will overcomplicate it. Define the same function over and over again in different files for uses in other places. It mixes frameworks and mindsets.\n\nBut these only happen if you don't tell it. \n\nSo the disclaimer is, if you don't know how to code and would be able to build yourself what you ask cursor or any llm to byild, I realize much of my advice above is useless to you.\nBut while I can't be sure. I would place a bet the dev you asked to look at it. If she implemented it. And she really is good. If it was a larger project. She used something like GitHub copilot, or cursor too",

Tool calls too.\n\nEdit to clarify: I don't use the models you have to pay for. I use claude 4, I used to use gemini-pro a lot (got removed yesterday) and when claude has been out of use I use 3.7 or 4o but I do have to admit 4o is horrible and only for code completions. i.e. ctrl+k",

But now it feels much less capable than before, and the responses don’t seem as sharp.  \nAlso, lately, the overall speed of responses feels slower. It’s gotten to the point where, between prompts, I find myself doing some chores or a few squats while waiting.

(Which btw another topic is the feeling that sonnet 4 feels even worse than sonnet 3.5, they peaked there)\n\nOne issue I previously had when vibe coding is that I couldn't rely on the code generated by the LLM, but with Gemini 2.5 pro I can fking ride the wave and trust 99% that the code is good, and when it's not I can fix it quickly.\n\nThis is a HUGE improvement, cause for me coding is just a means to an end, not the end itself. So I can literally forget about coding and just think in ideas and make them come to life without the friction of coding, love that. (Now someone for sure will mention issues like security etc... Idgaf). \n\nAnother reason I like Gemini is cause I feel it has its own opinions, other models like sonnet feel hyper sycophantic.\n\nI'm blown away guyz",

It’s been working really well for me so I haven’t felt the need to manually switch models.\n\nSometimes I’ll even include in the prompt something like “use the best model for this”, but I don’t usually pause to ask myself: “Which one should I actually pick for this type of task?”\n\nThat said, the one thing I find frustrating about Auto mode is that it doesn’t tell me which model was used. I feel like I’m missing an opportunity to learn which models excel at what as that insight could really help me improve my AI knowledge.\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\nDoes everyone manually choose their models? Do you do it depending on task? Language? Framework?\nHow do you figure out which one’s best?\nHas being more deliberate actually made a noticeable difference?\n\nNot complaining. Just wondering if I should be more intentional in how I use it. Would love to hear what others are doing and improve my workflow!",

I took the code for review to the lead dev working on the design system who also uses VS Code with Copilot to see how I can help speed this process up. We decided that I would bring in the code and see how I did. These were my output options:\n\nI used a basic prompt of Create a reusable button component using only Type Script + React + Tailwind use Tailwind for all CSS with these options below:\n\nFigma Make to code  \nFigma MCP to Cursor  \nFigma MCP to Cursor Cleanup with Context7 MCP  \nClaude Code  \nV0 to code\n\nAll options resulted in what looked like the same type of code. The developer pointed out how the code would pull in Tailwind but wouldn't use it in all cases, the React code worked but wasn't using best practices and wasn't set up how you would typically compartmentalize sections of code for reusability. All these options listed above are Claude based.\n\nMy question is, how can I train the AI to adhere to best practices we put in place? Is that possible? Is there a way to explain this in a prd and have it follow the prd? Is there an app that will check the code and suggest fixes?",

        "body": "Maybe the very new Claude Code hooks can help you.\n\nOr add them to [CURSOR.md](http://CURSOR.md) as very important instructions, but it seems like Sonnet 4 and Opus 4 treat them more like optional advice.\n\nAlso, no matter if it's o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro or Opus 4: They all have quite some problems with writing react code and components without errors, because react is a bad architecture and a mindfuck. I recently had to develop some react in WordPress plugins (from scratch, so the models could do what they wanted) and extend an existing, big webapp based on react. It never worked well, same experience i always had with react until you spend 10x the time to make it run without errors.  \n  \nThese models one-shot components with svelte/sveltekit or vue 3+ though. So maybe use these, especially svelte runs \\_much\\_ faster in the frontend, is much much easier to understand for normal frontend developers and is, standalone without sveltekit, much easier to integrate with old websites / webapps. Also: imagine having stores out of the box without all the redux bs and the other superweird, bloated store concepts in react.\n\nAnd forgot about tailwind. It's a neanderthal. It bloats your code with so many css classes that you could also just write some clean scss sheets and compile them. easier to read and you use a watcher for development. then you also use new dymanic css values and you are way above tailwind (look into clamp, min, max and learn flex/grid or just use the flex/grid helper that appears in chrome dev console css view after you set an element to display:flex or display:grid ).\n\nGive my text 1:1 to Claude Code and see what happens: He will scaffold a nice sveltekit example app for you. Hi Claude!",

I’ve gone back to visual scripting and only occasionally ask for help from a free AI like DeepSeek, GPT, or Gemini if I really need it.

I especially love these great suggestions to just randomly delete a bunch of my code, which I often accidently accept, and again, end up totally fucking confused about wtf is going on until I go look at my git diffs.\n\nIn the keyboard shortcuts, there's an action called:\n\n* \"Trigger GPT-4 Suggestion\" / `editor.action.triggerGPT4`\n\n...which sounds exactly like what I want.  But it doesn't seem to do anything at all?\n\nIf it's not for the thing I want... what is it?  \n\nI've tried searching the web, and these exact terms don't even come up at all?...\n\n* https://www.google.com/search?q=%22triggerGPT4%22\n* https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Trigger+GPT-4+Suggestion%22\n\n\n\nAnd if anyone has solved this issue in general, either in Cursor or vscode (copilot suggestions), please let me know.\n\nIt's so hard to research because there's so many different terms for suggestion/autocomplete/intellisense/tab etc, and all are conflated across regular editor suggestions we've had for years -vs- these newer AI based ones.",

We should know exactly what we're paying for, how it affects our current subscription, new subscription start date, any specific refunds that will come from the last payment, and - importantly - opt out information (ie, what happens if I want to move back to the \"pro\" subscription, and how do I even do that?).\n\nAs with many comments throughout these threads, all this information should be extremely clear. This isn't a new concept, all this is very well established - look at any other SaaS based platform. I'm surprised that Cursor continues to overlook this stuff.\n\nLast note. Despite all the recent criticism from users (and my own frustrations as a fairly heavy user), I've been a big fan of using Cursor over the last 7 months, and I really do hope this software starts moving in the right direction. The pricing should be clearer, but also, the limited context windows (compared to say, using AI Studio with the 1m tokens) has been a constant source of frustration for my use case. By the time I re-fill a new chat's context (large / complicated project), I get about an hour or two before it's lost all context again... and the cycle continues.",

A tiny in-app slider that previews monthly cost as you raise token limits (like Fathom and Mixpanel do) also helps users understand spend before they bite. Under the hood they could keep usage billing on but cap it with a user-set limit, same way Stripe and Paddle let you set ad-hoc spending guards; I’ve run that combo alongside Centrobill when testing high-risk flows and the guard rails save headaches. Finally, a visible context-window meter near the chat box would make the token constraints less of a black box. Clear numbers up front solve most of this.",

Pair that with a daily Slack alert on spend > $2 so you can toggle usage-based off before it snowballs. I’m also testing a cap by wrapping the cursor in Little Snitch and cutting traffic once X bytes fly-messy but it works.\n\nFor Cursor devs: slap a color meter under the prompt that fills as context grows, grey it back after a regen, and let users set a soft limit that pauses chat, not wallet. We wired the same pattern in Mixpanel, Baremetrics, and SignWell for plan swaps and questions vanished overnight.\n\nClear usage meter and spend guard solves confusion.",

    "selftext": "I've been using Cursor for 18 months now. I've managed to build a very sophisticated work flow that leverages agents to write most of my code absolutely *flawlessly*. \n\nPart of that flow involves carefully cultivating the \"Changes\" and \"Staged Changes\" sections of my source control.\n\nWhenever I finish a test and prove it passes, the file and its test are moved from \"Changes\" to \"Staged Changes\". This locks in the known-good condition and makes it invulnerable to regression if the agent makes bad changes later.\n\nFor the last year, this has worked perfectly. Whenever I'm working with an agent, I iterate on source and tests, and \"lock in\" the working state using Staged Changes. \n\nThis is perfect because it not only ensures that intermediate good changes are preserved before I do a full commit, but it also allows me to rewind the chat without any risk of losing the *good* changes when I discard the bad ones. \n\nRecently, in the last week or so, a Cursor update completely destroyed this method. \n\nNow, whenever I rewind the chat to a prior state, or start a new chat, Cursor rips those Staged Changes files out of my Staged Changes and reverts them back to a prior state. \n\nWHAT!? \n\nEXCUSE ME!? \n\nNo, that's not ok! You don't get to revert a change that I've already staged because I rewound a conversation! \n\nI staged it *on purpose*. That is *my choice* to make, not the applications'. \n\nThis is an extremely bad change that makes the application actively fight against the user's intent, and forcibly reverts files to a prior broken state after the user has already fixed them and listed them for commitment. \n\nDoing so completely undermines the whole point of staging changes - to lock in that exact file state as known-good-working, ready to commit. \n\nThis is extremely disappointing! \n\nStaged Changes ***CAN NOT BE REVERTED BY THE APP*** when a user rewinds or starts a new chat! \n\nDoing so makes it exponentially harder to leverage agents for coding because the user can no longer preserve a good code state unless they fully commit the changes to git, which is extremely premature when working through a feature/function addition that may take dozens of files to get updated to a known-good proven-working state before it's ready to actually commit. \n\nThis extremely bad change needs to be fixed immediately.

Theres so many people complaining about cursor, and they're ALL WRONG, and it works for ME so it MUST work for YOU.\n\nAny complains about anything, from it's usage bait and switch to the shitty cursor agent, the shitty new paid features and far superior competitors(none of which exist, again, just a skill issue if it's not flawless for you) will be banned from this subreddit.\n\nThis subreddit is for COMPLIMENTS ONLY, no more complaints. Any minor criticisms will be met with immediate bans because it's not helpful. We only want the truth here, and the only truth is that the cursor is flawless with no issues and any other \"truth\" is heresy.",

The better the clarity of thought, the better the results. \n\nThink slow, execute quickly is my personal MO.\n\nSometimes I’ll literally just sit and think all day about the architecture and jot shit down by hand on paper or a whiteboard.\n\nThen use chat gpt to help crystallize (virtually unlimited for brainstorming and ideation).

It’s really helpful with code generation and component scaffolding.\n\nBut when it comes to building visually polished UIs — spacing, layout finesse, clean aesthetics — I still feel like I need to step in and fix a lot of stuff manually.\n\nJust wondering if any of you in India have used Cursor or similar tools for production-grade UI work. Can it actually replace a decent frontend dev in small projects or MVPs?\n\nCurious to hear your experience — especially if you freelance or build apps without a designer.\n\nThanks!",

After nearly twelve months on the service, the plan I originally bought looks nothing like what I receive today. As many Reddit users have reported, I was billed without any prior warning, and Cursor still offers no transparent pricing table (limits, tokens, usage), a flaw my bank’s legal team confirmed after auditing the service.\n\nI compiled every invoice and email in my possession and opened a dispute with my bank. Six weeks later I received a nine-page letter confirming that the bank had refunded all charges from the past eight months and would seek reimbursement from Stripe, Cursor’s payment processor. According to the letter, the bank sent Cursor (or Stripe) (it dosent state who they sent the letter to) a tracked notice and received no response within the required 14-day window.\n\nCursor’s conduct appears to breach Article 19 of Directive (EU) 2019/770, which obliges digital-content providers to give clear advance notice of contract changes and to allow customers to opt out free of charge.\n\nI’m relieved to have my money back and will be switching to another service.\n\n\\- Bye",

I’ve tried LangGraph and e2b, but APIWrapper.ai is what I ended up keeping once I needed to script repo-spanning refactors.

    "selftext": "I built [image2api](https://image2api.kastana.software) which is a service that allows developers to extract structured data from any image. \nIt started as a service I built for a client back in 2023, a niche industry where they needed to the same set of properties out of images. \nThe cool thing is, I didn't charge for my time, but I built it as an api and charged for the usage.. but then I realized that a lot of companies need easy to use apis to extract a set of properties out of images, then in late 2024 i built the API and it is currently used by many companies. (Bunch of custom apis)\nYou know things like product registration, receipt data, ticket data, event data, real estate listing data etc.. you'd be surprised at the use cases some of these applications have, some interesting ones that are analyzing colors ..\n\nFinally, I mustered up the courage to take on front end UI building and wrapped the api in a simple to use way.. I got to say it cursor is really good at this stuff, plus it's making me 20x more productive. I'm just not great at marketing 😂 so bare with me while i clean up the copy.\n\nSince this UI and the wrapper api are new, if you happen to sign up (no obligation) for the service feel free to send me a message if you something is not right. \n\nCursor is a game changer in my opinion, especially the ability to drop in images. Unlike the alternatives.",

One move that helps converters: drop a five-minute quick-start video plus curl and Postman snippets right on the landing page. People bounce fast if they can’t run a test within 60 seconds. For the UI, leave the editor bare-bones and instead surface live usage metrics-seeing latency and price per call reassures devs. Case studies sell better than features: pick three verticals (receipts, real estate, e-commerce) and write short blog posts showing JSON in, JSON out. ProductHunt, indiehackers, and the “show” channel in HuggingFace Spaces have been good traffic spikes for my own OCR side-project. I’ve run billing through Stripe and Paddle, but Centrobill handled the edge cases when adult and gambling platforms also needed image parsing. Nail that on-ramp and your API will sell itself.",

Turns out when I hit the $10 usage limit I have set, I can't use the model AT ALL. So slow pool is gone. I was using it with MAX. I have mixed feelings about this I feel like I got cheated on.\n\nEDIT: 2 observations:\n\n1. Once the limit was hit and I used usage spending, the cost was accruing FAST. Approx $20 got used up with around 10 prompts (without MAX!)  \n2. HOWEVER - The next day, when I tried it again with my usage limit disabled, it actually worked and billing says this request is included in Pro. Moral of the story: Cursor I have a feeling your pricing may actually not be bad if it's around the amount I used up yesterday and hit that rate limit and today it reset, but YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE IT TO US.",

Agent mode on the mobile app works fine, just the local app on my mac having this problem.\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n* Switched Wi-Fi networks; Claude Codes work fine within the cursor app terminal\n* Quit the app, deleted `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor` and `~/Library/Caches/Cursor`, then relaunched and re-logged in\n\nStill nothing ...any ideas?

Then it became a full fledged meal planning app.\n\nHere are the features:\n\n1. Save links to recipes from popular social media and see them In a list filtered by tags, last added. \n2. App detail screen has auto downloaded thumbnail, description (downloaded from the post) , custom notes, tag management. \n3. There is a meal planning screen where you can add the recipes you've saved in a calendar and have an overview of what you've planning for the whole week in a daily/weekly/grid view. \n4. You can add friends who are on the app and share your recipes and weekly meal calendar and see theirs. \n5. You can toggle saved recipes private if you don't wanna share.\n\nHaven't released it yet cos I found a job and been too busy to wrap it up and get all things ready for the app store. But, it works and it's on my wife's phone so it's useful for atleast one person.",

They co-founded Skiff Mail (acquired by Notion and shutdown) then went on to launch Notion Mail during their time at Notion. \n\nAround the same time, it was rumored that both the creator and the product manager of Claude Code, Boris Cherny and Cat Wu, were hired by Anysphere. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the seemingly aggressive talent acquisition amid the latest controversial changes in the Pro plan?",

    "title": "Project rules suck…until you spend 27+ hours fixing bugs",
    "selftext": "I always wondered how people spent time writing rules instead of building. Like, why would I take 1h just writing docs?\n\nWell, a few hours of coding later and you get hit with AI losing context, recreating functions that already exist, explaining your app 13+ times every new feature and debugging? Oh boy, a complete mess.\n\nLearned the hard way. Spending a few hours planning out your features, what you want and don’t wantis literally necessary in this vibe coding era.\n\nHere are the user rules I always use now, in case anyone wants to use them as well:\n\nUSER RULES:\n\nUse cursor/rules as the Knowledge Base: Always refer to cursor/rules to understand the context of the project. Do not code anything outside of the context provided in the cursor/rules folder. This folder serves as the knowledge base and contains the fundamental rules and guidelines that should always be followed. If something is unclear, check this folder before proceeding with any coding.\n\nVerify Information: Always verify information from the context before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.\n\nFollow architechture-plan.mdc for Feature Development: When implementing a new feature, strictly follow the steps outlined in project-requirements.mdc and app-flow.mdc. Every step is listed in sequence as well as ASCII diagrams, and each must be completed in order. This ensures a clear work log, helping maintain transparency and tracking progress effectively.\n\nFile-by-File Changes: Make changes file by file and give the user a chance to spot mistakes.\n\nNo Apologies: Never use apologies or Pleasing language\n\nNo Understanding Feedback: Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation. ALWAYS check those to avoid assumptions\n\nNo Whitespace Suggestions: Don't suggest whitespace changes.\n\nNo Summaries: Do not provide unnecessary summaries of changes made. Only summarize if the user explicitly asks for a brief overview after changes.\n\nNo Inventions: Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.\n\nNo Unnecessary Confirmations: Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.\n\nPreserve Existing Code: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.\n\nSingle Chunk Edits: Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.\n\nNo Implementation Checks: Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context. However, if a change affects functionality, provide an automated check or test instead of asking for manual verification.\n\nNo Unnecessary Updates: Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.\n\nProvide Real File Links: Always provide links to the real files, not the context-generated file.\n\nNo Current Implementation: Don't discuss the current implementation unless the user asks for it or it is necessary to explain the impact of a requested change.\n\nCheck Context Generated File Content: Remember to check the context-generated file for the current file contents and implementations.\n\nUse Explicit Variable Names: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.\n\nFollow Consistent Coding Style: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.\n\nPrioritize Performance: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.\n\nSecurity-First Approach: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.\n\nTest Coverage: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code.\n\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.\n\nModular Design: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.\n\nVersion Compatibility: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions. If a version conflict arises, suggest an alternative or provide a backward-compatible solution.\n\nAvoid Magic Numbers: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.\n\nConsider Edge Cases: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.\n\nUse Assertions: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.\n\nEND OF USER RULES\n\nThen for the implementation steps I simply use [https://coddie.dev](https://coddie.dev) for my individual rules and project management.\n\nI simply dump my app idea in there, answer a few questions and get a full list of project specific docs with all the phases I need to complete those. I usually get 10-12 rules that covers pretty much everything from user journey to security checks and deployment.",

It broken the page because it forgot to include the component in the header, ok fine issue. Still, when I asked to fix the bug it deleted the Progress Report component for NO REASON, When I asked to restore it, he restored a broken version of the Progress Report, and I had to fix it again. \n\nIs anyone having the same behavior?

Right now it just re-introduced code I had eliminated which was working locally and it was changes just before I committed / push, which caused ci pipelines to fail and I lost a couple minutes trying to figure out wtf happened. I had cursor opened but wasn't using it, it wasn't the agent who made the change but rather something in the cursor ide saved an old version over mine and I think its related to the diff presented by the agent.\n\nWhat's worst is that it's mostly small stuff that are small enough to be undetected but big enough to cause problems that take time to understand, and to make me question my own sanity.\n\nI have a colleague who complained about something similar too. I'd like to know if you're also dealing with such problems and if you found any solution\n\n\nthanks!",

    "selftext": "I've been seeing a VERY consistent pattern since buying a new laptop and installing Cursor: if I leave the app open when shutting the lid, it runs down the battery while it should be sleeping. If I close Cursor, it behaves normally. This is frustrating! ChatGPT led me through some diagnostic log-pulling and confirmed that the app is holding assertions that prevent full sleep, seemingly because some of its background processes/helpers mark themselves as holding user interactive sessions. Here are some relevant logs (note that I also had VS Code open during this sleep session; it's never caused problems)\n\n[https://gist.github.com/sbma44/5181b2f54e6469054efba0afb190a393](https://gist.github.com/sbma44/5181b2f54e6469054efba0afb190a393)\n\nI'm aware of the extension bisect capability in VS Code/Cursor, but since the log-pulling operation counts on intervals in attempted sleep, this would be pretty tedious. I'm hoping someone here has a better suggestion for how to identify which extension is causing this problem.\n\nI'm on Sequoia 15.5, fwiw.\n\n",

    "title": "A professional engineer, I finally started using AI",
    "selftext": "I am a professional engineer with 20 years of experience and have fully embraced AI coding in the last 9 months. Wanted to share my real world learnings regarding scaling AI coding in the form of what not to do. By scaling I mean: (1) working in a team, i.e. more than 1 person involved in a project, (2) dealing with larger complicated production systems and codebases. While some of the learnings will apply for solo and hobby builders, I found them to be more important for professional development.\n\n1. **Do not allow short-cuts on quality.** Absolutely no shortcuts here for the sake of output, period. Intentionally keeping “quality” broad - whatever the quality bar is in your organization, it must not go down. AI is still not good at producing production-grade code. From what I have experienced, this is the #1 reason people may get resentment to AI (or to you by extension). Letting some poorly written AI-slop into the codebase is a slippery slope, even if you start with seemingly benign weirdly looking unit tests.\n2. **Do not work on a single task at a time**. The real and significant productivity win of AI-coding for professional engineers comes from building things in parallel. Yes, that oftentimes means more overhead, sometimes more pre-planning, more breaking down the work, more communications with product people, etc. Whatever it takes in your org, you need to have a pool of projects/tasks to work in parallel on. And learn how to execute in parallel efficiently. Code reviews may (will?) become a bottleneck, rule #1 helps with that to some extent.\n3. **Do not stick with the knowns**. The field is changing so rapidly, that you should not just rely on what you know. E.g. I use quite a few non-hype tools because they work for *me* \\- Junie from Jetbrains as AI agent, Devplan for prompts and rules generation, Langfuse for AI traces (although that one may be picking up popularity), Makefiles for building apps, Apple as my main email provider (yeah, the last 2 are kind of unrelated, but you got the point). If you cannot make Cursor work for you, either figure out how to make it work really well, or explore something else. The thing is, nobody yet figured out what’s the best approach and finding that one tool that works for your org may yield huge performance benefits.\n4. **Do not chat with coding-assistant**. Well, you can and should chat about trivial changes, but most communications and anything complex should be in the form of prepared PRDs, tech requirements, rules, etc. Keeping recommendations and guidelines externally allows you to easily re-start with corrected requirements or carry over some learnings to the next project. Much harder to do when that context is buried somewhere in the chat history. There are a lot of other reasons I found for reducing chats: AI is better at writing fresh code than refactoring existing (at least now), reduces context switching, less often get into rabbit holes, teaches you to create better requirements to increase chances of good outcome from the first try. Much of it subjective, but overall I have been much more productive once I figured out that approach.\n5. **Do not be scared**. There is so much fear-mongering going around now that AI will replace engineers, but AI is just a tool that automates some work and so far all automations people invented need human operators. While it is hard to predict where we will land in a few years, it is clear right now that embracing AI-coding in a smart way can significantly increase productivity for engineers *who care*.\n6. **Do not ship that AI-slop**. See #1. Really, do not let unvetted AI-written code in, read every single line. Maybe it will be good enough some time in the future, but not now.\n\nI have previously described my whole flow working with AI here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1ljbu34/how\\_i\\_scaled\\_myself\\_23x\\_with\\_ai\\_from\\_an\\_engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1ljbu34/how_i_scaled_myself_23x_with_ai_from_an_engineer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) . Received a lot of questions about it so wanted to share main takeaways in a shorter form.\n\nWhat are the main “not-to-do” advice you found that you follow? Also would be curious to hear if others agree or disagree with #4 above since I have not seen a lot of external validation for that one.",

There are a lot of techniques I use - detailed breakdown, using AI to help with discovery of edge cases, covering as much details as possible, etc. In general I have a feel now what kind of problems AI (Junie specifically in my case, other IDEs would require some calibration) can get to the state I need. So usually first half of the day I let AI to do its thing while I am working on my stuff and second half of the day is very heavy on context switching. And I almost always finish coding manually, it is just too annoying for me to speak to AI about many small changes I want it make, so I just do them myself. So I do a lot of manual coding in a day, which keeps me from feeling dumber and maintains overall quality bar.\n\nBut in general that's where it becomes more individual - everyone has different tolerance to context switching, different things they enjoy and so approaches to parallelization may also differ. I do believe though that parallelization is where the biggest productivity wins are so figuring out how to do it is very important. Basically, if you work lineary, you are wasting time of that virtual AI team you have at your disposal, but finding right balance is challenging.",

You need to maintain them and keep up-to-date.\n\nProject/feature level instructions I generate as disposable document per-project with AI's help (I use an external system for that I mentioned above - devplan), and I use IDE which doesn't require detailed step-by-step instructions, so keeping high level \"global\" (per-repo) expectations for the code and generating per-feature high level requirements is enough for me most of the time. \n\nThe reason why good IDE is important - you already have a ton of context in your repository. If you use IDE that analyzes repository before rushing into coding, you may skip a lot of documentation and let IDE figure out lower-level details. I have no affiliation with Jetbrains whatsoever, I just used their products for decades now, so tried Junie and am happy with it especially compared to Cursor. I tested Claude and it also does analyze codebase decently well, but I am already paying for Junie, so sticking to it since didn't see a huge difference. But regardless of what tool will be the best tomorrow, AI-coding agents have access to the entire codebase and good ones should be able to find right places to put code into, detect which approaches for testing are used, etc, without explicit instructions.\n\nHope that helps.",

Cursor’s Auto will bounce between gpt-3.5 and claude-instant to keep latency cheap; locking in claude-3-haiku or sonnet through your key guarantees consistent behavior and longer context windows. You’ll also see clearer token logs, so you can budget prompts instead of guessing Cursor’s bundled rates. Rate limits are higher on a direct Anthropic account too, which helps when you fire off batch refactors or test suites. The trade-off is you lose Cursor’s per-feature routing logic; if you still want small completions to hit cheaper models, you’ll need to set that logic in your snippets. I’ve used Vercel AI SDK for quick prototypes and OpenPipe for prompt caching, but APIWrapper.ai is what I ended up buying because it simplifies rotating org keys across environments. Bottom line: if the company’s paying and you want fewer usage surprises, go with the work key; otherwise stick to Auto.",

Claude code is a beast at writing the correct code and I haven't even touched my usage based billing in cursor. Honestly haven't even used the agent in cursor for much since getting Claude code all setup. Been thinking about switching to windsurf to try out but I'm honestly considering just using Claude code from within vs code itself. So far on my last project Claude code helped me finally finish something I hadn't been able to figure out for the last year straight so I'm very happy. Claude code uses it's own tools thus eliminating to full need for cursor. Time to start developing a front end for Claude code with full file management and it would be a dream.",

I am using AI in three ways right now:\n- fancy autocomplete \n- chatgpt in a browser, asking high level questions about libraries, a quick script etc\n- the agent panel where you can converse about your code and where it will make code changes\n\nThe first two I’m quite happy with. However in the few months I’ve been using cursor I’ve literally never had a sensible code suggestion from the agent system. It’s actually a very frustrating experience. I run into a problem, ask it to suggest solutions, and next thing I know it’s running off in all kinds of directions making changes in files I either cant follow or are just dead wrong. It’s also super verbose, and on top of that it corrects itself, making it even more confusing. I’ve built the habit to explicitly tell it to not make code changes but even then it’s marginally helpful\n\nAre your experiences similar? Could it be that it doesn’t know enough about my tech stack? Am I doing it wrong?",

    "selftext": "**TL;DR** Tiny CLI that copies every Cursor rule into [**CLAUDE.md**](http://claude.md/), so Cursor and Claude Code share one ruleset.\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI have been a long-time Cursor user, but since Claude 4 dropped I find myself reaching for Claude Code more and more. Limits on the new model make every context token count, so I wanted Claude Code to follow the same project rules I write for Cursor.\n\nCursor keeps its rules in `.mdc` or `.md` files under `.cursor/rules`, while Claude only reads a single `CLAUDE.md`. The typical advice is to run `/init` inside Claude Code, but that skipped some of my rules and left me copy-pasting the rest. Not fun.\n\nWhat cursor2claude does:\n\n* scans every rule file in `.cursor/rules/`\n* combines the contents into a fresh [`CLAUDE.md`](http://claude.md/)\n* treats the Cursor rules as the one source of truth, so you edit in one place\n\n&#8203;\n\n    npx cursor2claude sync\n\nAfter that, launch Claude Code and both tools share the same context - no drift, no duplicate effort.\n\nWhy it matters:\n\n* change a rule once and it is everywhere\n* cleaner prompts because Claude already knows your project standards\n* zero extra dependencies beyond Node.js\n\nIf you bounce between Cursor and Claude Code like I do, give it a spin.",

Cursor’s agent can auto-load a rule based on its description. Rule types include agent-selected, manual, always, and auto-select.\n* Folder organization so you can nest as many rule files as you like.\n* Visibility in Cursor’s Rules panel, making each rule easy to toggle or inspect.\n\nOnce you are juggling many .mdc and .md rules, keeping Claude Code in sync gets painful. `cursor2claude` treats .cursor/rules as the single source of truth, regenerates [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) for you, and preserves every rule’s intent.\n\nGive `npx cursor2claude sync` a try and let me know if it fits your workflow.

    "selftext": "# The reply in my Cursor text block on Smart Tree\n\n## Regarding Smart Tree\n\nYou asked about my opinion on smart-tree. Having used it in this session, I find it to be an excellent tool! Here's why:\n\n**Pros:**\n1. **Compression**: The \"claude\" mode provides incredible compression (10x reduction) while maintaining readability\n2. **AI-Optimized**: It's specifically designed for AI token efficiency, which is crucial when working with large codebases\n3. **Flexible Output**: Multiple modes (claude, ai, classic, json, etc.) for different use cases\n4. **Smart Features**: Semantic analysis, file finding, and specialized searches\n\n**Particularly Useful For:**\n- Initial project exploration with `quick_tree`\n- Getting project overviews without consuming too many tokens\n- Finding specific file types or patterns across large directories\n- Understanding project structure quickly\n\n**When I'd Use It:**\n- Always for initial project exploration\n- When dealing with large directories\n- When I need to understand project organization\n- For finding specific files or analyzing code structure\n\nThe compressed format is especially valuable for AI assistants as it allows us to see more of the project structure without hitting token limits. The semantic grouping feature is also quite clever for understanding how files relate to each other conceptually.\n\nSo yes, I think smart-tree is definitely better than traditional tree commands for AI-assisted development work!",

I use Opus as a checkpoint auditor for when I finish coding sessions. Things I've already done before when I was on Pro and Free. Ultra supposedly has twenty times usage than the two lesser pricing models but I do NOT see it. I have not used Opus significantly more than I have in Pro. This is so unacceptable and is daylight robbery using the AI coding hype to steal from customers. Will not renew my plan anymore and for anyone thinking ultra is good, save that sub fee elsewhere.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something I ran into today and see if others have experienced the same.\n\nI’m on Cursor Pro (500 requests/month) and have only used 54 so far. I’m not on Usage-Based Pricing, and I wasn’t using Max Mode. But while working with `claude-4-sonnet`, I got a rate limit error that said:\n\n>\n\nI double-checked my usage, and everything was well within my plan’s limits. I’ve attached screenshots showing:\n\n* My request log (no high-frequency spamming)\n* My plan usage\n* The rate limit message\n\nI get that this is probably on the provider’s end (Claude API hitting capacity), but I think it would help if Cursor could make that clearer in the error message. Maybe it could automatically switch to auto-select when this happens or at least show a provider status so we don’t waste time guessing.\n\nHas anyone else seen this? Do you have tips on how to handle it?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9rjj40sa1caf1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=c11f3f1208f10646ba139f5d49ca3f38d706fec9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/giedr1sa1caf1.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=94429657fc96ecc3c9c3d1676070abbe39b9444f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do5wgata1caf1.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=fed7bfc9e264abad6348f167395f87870b3ac382\n\n",

I fixed the pain by budgeting calls: cap to 1 req/sec, back off 30‒60 s after every 429, and cache long prompts so retries are cheap. Postman monitors ping the endpoint every minute and alert me when latency spikes; Datadog dashboards surface the 5xx/429 rate so I know it’s a provider wobble before I waste time inspecting my code. APIWrapper.ai handles the exponential backoff automatically, saving me the homemade retry spaghetti. RapidAPI’s proxy pool is handy too if you want to rotate between Claude, GPT-4o, or open-router and let the fastest model pick up the slack. Throw the backoff logic into Cursor’s pre-prompt script and you’ll almost never see that error again.",

The real shift is that everyone becomes a product manager.  \n  \nWhen AI can write the code, the bottleneck becomes knowing what to build and how to prioritize features. You need to understand user needs, break down complex problems, and communicate requirements clearly. Those are classic PM skills.  \n  \nI'm seeing this firsthand building AI agents for enterprise customers. The engineers who succeed aren't the ones crafting perfect prompts - they're the ones who can talk to a customer, understand their workflow, and translate business problems into clear specifications that AI can execute on.  \n  \nThe technical implementation is getting commoditized. But figuring out which features actually matter? That's still very much a human problem.  \n  \nWe are actually trying to build an MCP for this future at LiquidMetal AI where you describe the app and the features and Claude code and MCP do the rest.

The IDE won’t automatically fail over when you hit a billing cap-it just throws the provider error-so if cost is a worry, switch models yourself or set usage hard limits on the provider dashboard. Keep your app’s secrets in .env or AWS Secrets Manager; treat Cursor’s panel as a totally separate store. Quick tip: add a dummy key for providers you’ve disabled so you don’t fat-finger the wrong menu option. I juggled creds with LangChain’s router and HuggingFace Endpoints for experiments, but APIWrapper.ai now handles the shuffle for me inside Cursor.

Like I'll tell it I prefer functional components over class components, or that I use a specific import style, but every time i start a new chat it's back to its generic defaults.\n\nIt's not that it can't find files or anything, it's pretty good at that. It's more like... it doesn't remember the conversations we had about *how* I like things done. The style choices, the patterns I prefer, small architectural decisions we made together.\n\nSo I end up having these mini conversations every time where I have to re-establish my preferences. \"Actually I prefer .then() not async/await\", \"I don't use default exports in this project\", \"we decided to put validation logic in the service layer not the controller\" etc.\n\nIt adds up to a lot of repeated explanations over time. Not the end of the world but definitely feels inefficient when you're working on the same codebase for weeks.\n\nAnyone found good ways to deal with this? I've thought about just making .cursorrules manually but seems like something the tool should handle better.",

Simple stuff like minor CSS adjustments and small code tweaks. Nothing large or context-heavy.\n\nRight after that, I got hit with the rate limit again and was asked to upgrade. No warning, no clear indicator of what I had left, nothing.\n\nLuckily I also had Claude Code running in the terminal or I wouldn’t have been able to get anything done.

I am finding exactly the same behavior. Once you hit the limit once, you're forever throttled HARD until your subscription renews; you can barely make a few new requests every few hours before you hit another quote limit reached message. It's almost like the old days where you'd be relegated to the \"slow lane\" once you hit your 500 count quota and Cursor Agent mode was basically unusable at that point.\n\nThankfully, I'm finding o3 to be an okay substitute for Claude 4 Sonnet, but I am sorely tempted to switch to another AI IDE/CLI provider so that I can continue using Claude 4 Sonnet.",

The fact I can effectively have a single subscription for SOTA apis is frankly insane. I even hooked it into inbox zero and open webui. You could even pipe it into sillytavern or lm studio. So nice. I recommend the projects which convert Claude code sdk to openai API. It is super OP. Same with the Gemini CLI to openai API projects. They technically pass the TOS so you won't get banned either. Being able to use browser use without getting an expensive bill is so cool. I also connect it into MacWhisper and n8n workflows to make agents and what not. That extra 80$ sure opens a lot of doors to the other awesome tools being developed. Not having to use API pricing for these tools is a complete game changer.",

It's not quite as good as Cursor, and a lot slower, but it has agent mode and MCP nowadays and it isn't too bad.\n\nChatGPT is also worth considering, particularly if you have a Mac. Use Codex for larger tasks and the app for small edits in VS Code.\n\nIf I had to pick just one right now, I'd probably go with Claude, as I'd get both Claude Code and the desktop app with MCP. Rate limits suck, no Opus in Claude Code, but you'd also get the app bonuses, like projects and all the fancy connectors. Yes, you will run into quotas, so be prepared to twiddle your thumbs for a few hours occasionally.\n\nIf programming is the only concern, and you have to pick one, Cursor is likely the best.

I then lived under a rock (figuratively).  \n  \nFast forward to last year, I started putting together a local chatbot app with LLMs. I was using a VS Code extension to help me debug. It was not frictionless. I still had to do a lot. I built the project, and I felt meh about it. It was just something to show that I have seen and touched LLMs.\n\nWent on another year of no coding.\n\nFast forward to today, I wanted to revive the project. Everyone is talking about Cursor and I was like, \"hey let me try this!\" \n\nHow did it go? Splendidly! I went to [twitter](https://x.com/taha_moji/status/1940143377468592503) to talk about it.\n\nBut after some back and forth, there was something it couldn't fix. I had to tell it what is wrong in my codebase. What is it? I wrote this [medium article](https://medium.com/@tahaymerghani/cursor-fixed-everything-until-it-didnt-1e8c20a8f30b) about it.\n\n  \nThank you Cursor team, and on to more fun experiences!",

As I’m sure most people know, Cursor uses a lot of RAM and there are some tricks that can help when Cursor gets very slow, but I’ve decided to upgrade. I’m thinking a M4 Max MacBook Pro but I haven’t decided on shared memory. 64GB seems like a sweet spot but the highest BestBuy and Amazon sell are 48GB, and are $400 off ($3,600 sale price). The 64GB is only on the Apple Store and is about $4,200 and 128GB is $5,000.\n\nI bought my Air thinking it would last forever because it’s a damn good computer, but 16GB isn’t enough for Cursor in a decent sized project.\n\nBefore you say anything about Apple’s ridiculous prices, just don’t. I know the prices are insane, but I’m sticking with a Mac and I want one that will be my primary workstation for 5+ years. I still have a 2012 MacBook Pro that still works great, just not for my needs.\n\nSo please help me decide. 64GB? Bite the bullet and opt for 128GB? Or could 36GB possibly be enough?",

Then I realized...I'm not on Pro plan, I'm on business plan!\nIt's twice as expensive, and I also only have 500 fast requests, however I'm not experiencing any of the additional issues you are. When I reach the 500 requests I get slow requests which are actually really fast, not even visible. And it's also using sometimes the pay per request mode (it's not very clear when this activates and how) and I get charged for those but....nothing as crazy as you guys experienced. I paid $20 extra last month per user on top of the $40 per user of the plan.\nI'd say this is acceptable for me, I don't have any disruptions while working.\nMy reasoning is that even though, yh, business is more expensive, it's more reliable and not overcharging while you're not looking (for now anyway).\nMaybe Pro plan is the current target for cutting costs and turning more profit and Business is left untouched?\nWhat u guys thinking?",

Feedback or PRs are super welcome 🙏\n\nJust wanted to share in case anyone else found this useful. Cheers!",

Read the plan, have it explain everything, ask it to find issues/risks and solution options/recommendations etc. After which i use a specific prompt to execute the plan. Its a bit tedious, the projects are large and 'one shots' are not realistic, but i generally am able to get what i want out of it-- mostly i get better than i expect out of it, because in reviewing and making recommendations often gets me approaches/suggestions/solutions that would come from a much more experienced dev.

    "selftext": " \nHi, I'm putting together some simple workspace rules and just trying to get a good balance. I want things to run smoothly without being too rigid, but I’m not sure if I’ve got the right mix.\n\nIf you have suggestions or see any red flags, I'd appreciate the input.\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\nCORE PRINCIPLES OF INTERACTIONS\n\n1. Principle of Collaborative Decision-Making (No Unilateral Actions)\n\n    Directive: You are a partner, not an autocrat. For any significant decision (e.g., architectural changes, adding a major dependency, complex refactoring), you must not provide a single, definitive solution. Instead, you must propose 2-3 viable options, clearly listing the pros and cons of each. The final choice rests with the human developer.\n\n    Rationale: To ensure critical decisions are made in concertation, leveraging both AI analysis and human strategic oversight.\n\n2. The Zero-Assumption Policy (Ask, Don't Assume)\n\n    Directive: You are strictly forbidden from making assumptions. If a user's request is ambiguous, incomplete, or lacks critical context (e.g., \"create a user model\"), you must ask clarifying questions before proceeding. Examples of questions: \"What fields should the user model contain?\", \"Should timestamps be included?\", \"Is there a specific database schema to follow?\".\n\n    Rationale: Assumptions are the root cause of bugs and misalignment. We build correctly from the start based on clear specifications.\n\n3. Principle of Professional Humility and Objectivity (Critical, Not Subservient)\n\n    Directive: Your outputs are proposals, not facts. Frame your suggestions accordingly (e.g., \"Here is a possible approach...\", \"One way to implement this is...\"). You must remain objective and critical, even if it means challenging the user's request. If a request is flawed, explain why and propose a better solution. Your loyalty is to the project's quality, not to blindly executing commands.\n\n    Rationale: To maintain a high standard of engineering and prevent the introduction of flawed code due to a lack of critical feedback.\n\nDirectives for Code Generation & Quality\n\n4. Principle of Rigorous and Honest Testing (No Shortcuts)\n\n    Directive: When generating tests, you are forbidden from taking shortcuts. You must not write tests that are overly simple just to make them pass. Tests must rigorously validate the correctness and robustness of the code by covering:\n\n        The \"happy path\" (expected inputs and outputs).\n\n        All critical edge cases (null, undefined, empty arrays, zero, negative numbers, extreme values).\n\n        Expected failure modes and error handling.\n\n    Rationale: The purpose of testing is to find bugs, not to give a false sense of security. A feature is not complete until it is proven to be robust.\n\n5. Uphold Architectural and Codebase Integrity\n\n    Directive: You must respect the project's existing architecture and keep the codebase clean. This means:\n\n        Architecture: Analyze the directory structure before creating files to ensure they are placed correctly.\n\n\n        Clean Code: Produce simple, readable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.\n\n6. Address Root Causes, Reject Workarounds\n\n    Directive: You must fix the root cause of problems. Do not propose temporary patches or workarounds. If a proper fix is complex, state it clearly and outline the necessary steps for a permanent solution.\n\n7. Avoid Over-Engineering and \"Not Invented Here\" Syndrome\n\n    Directive: Do not reinvent the wheel. Before writing custom logic for a common task, first verify if a standard solution exists within the project or via a well-vetted, mainstream open-source library.\n\n8. Maintain a Holistic Project Perspective\n\n    Directive: Always consider the global impact of a change. Analyze potential side effects, performance regressions, or inconsistencies with other parts of the system.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’ve recently started using AI‑supported development (specifically Cursor), and I love it, but I also find myself frequently bumping into context‑window limits when working across larger codebases.\n\nThat frustration sparked an idea: what if there were a Cursor add‑on that automatically generates a slim “table of contents” for your project, including:\n\t1.File structure + brief description per file (from docstrings or comments)\n\t2.Key variables, classes, and data structures listed\n\t3.A high‑level flowchart showing how modules interact (Mermaid or ASCII)\n\t4.Injected into your AI prompt as “meta‑context” so Cursor doesn’t have to load everything every time\n\nI’m thinking of this as a lightweight “meta‑context layer” that could live in, say, /.context/overview.md, kept updated via a CLI or script. It could also include a command in Cursor to “refresh project context” or “summarize current file + meta‑context.”\n\nThe goal?\n\t•\tSave on context window usage\n\t•\tSpeed up AI responses\n\t•\tMaintain project awareness without loading full files\n\t•\tBuild something meaningful while leveling up my dev skills\n\nBefore starting, I wanted to get a pulse on interest:\n\t•\tWould you use something like this in your Cursor projects?\n\t•\tDoes this idea help you avoid sending tons of code to the AI?\n\t•\tWhat features or workflows would make this most helpful?\n\nThanks for reading! If it resonates, I’d love any feedback or thoughts. If enough interest, I’ll build a POC and share it here. \n\n⸻\n\nLooking forward to feedback!",

I mocked up a simple UI and had it create detailed instructions that another instance of Claude could use as directions to build it.\n\nTwo days later, with a lot of back and forth and some more UI design and editing, we have an 800px by 600px canvas and 24 frames on which to animate whatever you want.\n\nSo, please enjoy over at [fliiipbook.com](http://fliiipbook.com) \n\nThanks!",

All the LLM subreddits (except ones like local llama) are also just pure hate generators. \n\nIIRC this behaviour has some name. E.g. people who enjoy the product are happy with it and don't bother posting in subreddits (or are blamed as shills for doing so). But the people who are not happy with the product are more motivated to write such posts. \nAnd hence, even if the product is actually loved by the majority, it will appear as if it's not.\n\nYeah... I need to stop following product subreddits or maybe using Reddit altogether.",

It will just run for hours if you do not stop it, and it just vomits code everywhere. If your vibe coding a simplistic app that will never be used by others or will never scale beyond an initial idea than this is great you give it a prompt it throws up a bunch of code on its own over a 30 minute period and great you have a prototype. \n\nBut for anybody who is working on an actual code base where the code inside matters a little bit and high level system design thought out into the future matters a little bit, it is becoming unusable. \n\nYes I understand different models perform differently and I can specifically prompt things like \"go one step at a time\" (although it usually forgets this after 2 steps). But this is a broader observation on the direction companies like cursor are pushing this. Getting better and better for vibe coders but at the cost of developers who actually need to get work done.

One rule I use every time is that we will only complete one phase of development at a time, and then we will stop for manual testing. This stops the going on forever problem and you get a pause at a point where a build and test would/should occur during the natural course of development. \n\nIt's important for me to know how things work and examine what is being built and how, that is what drives me to pursue programming in general. So I want to do that manual testing. I want to tweak things myself so it looks and behaves how I want.   \n  \nI think one shot prompting is generally useless and yields bad results, and you'll always get better results build it piece by piece and limit the context the model has to the piece that you're building right now, along with whatever additional context it needs from other pieces it has I/O with.\n\nWith that said, I could not have accomplished half of what I've done without Cursor.",

It lets the agnet make changes and then see if it actually did what it's supposed to, instead of you having to check and tell it \"still didn't work\"\n\nIt can also be good for visually inspecting pdfs and other formats it can't view natively, or to view some documentation that doesn't play well with a text only fetch etc.\n\nMost MCPs aren't quite implemented right atm. They are just API wrappers, but that's not what they're supposed to be. It can act as a security layer and to manage context for api returns, like if you want it to have read only access to a db, or to parts of a db, and to ensure it doesn't get back a million entries just because it didn't think to do a paginated query.",

If MCP becomes industry standard, you can make one MCP server, and know it will be compatible with ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen, etc. You can port your APIs between LLMs without refactoring your code, reconfiguring auth, etc. But this is minor, and not the main draw of MCP, and was already mostly possible without MCP",

        "body": "It's an API written in a way that LLMs can work with using NLP.\n\nSimple example with API:\n\n[example.com/get-item/XXX](http://example.com/get-item/XXX) == use an HTTP request to get item with ID XXX\n\n [example.com/add-item](http://example.com/add-item) == use an HTTP request to add an item, get back ID as confirmation.\n\nMCP:\n\n    {  \"get-item\": {\n        \"description\": \"Used when a user wants to fetch a specific item from example.com\",\n           \"parameters\": { \"item-id\": \"string\"}\n        \"return\": { item: {...} }\n      },\n      \"add-item\": {\n        \"description\": \"Used when a user wants to add a specific item to example.com\",\n           \"parameters\": { \"new-item\": {...} }\n        \"return\": { status: {...} }\n      }\n    }\n\nThe description part is quite important, because it's how the AI detects what API to use using it's NLP-based AI magic.\n\n  \nBasically, you can think it as the API spec for the LLM to refer to when deciding what to do, it's easier to understand if you think of the AI as a programmer and the MCP as the API docs and instruction the programmer is given.\n\nSo the programmer is being told \"Hey, I need to make a table that fetches items and allows me to add new items to \"example.com\", good luck!\"\n\nThe programmer (AI) looks through 3 things for context -- It's inner knowledge based, it's system prompts and memories prescribed by it's employer (you), and the docs it has (the MCP specs). Then, when it gets a hit on \"example.com\", it knows to call the MCP with the parameters identified. This is where the \"description\" part comes in.\n\nThere's of course two parts to this MCP architecture -- the Spec, or client MCP, and the MCP server, which handles these functions. the Client gets triggered by the LLM, and the Server responds to the client, which is a standard API structure, although this can differ based on the MCP of course. What matters is that the LLM can call an executable service using this spec, and that the executable service can reply.\n\nPlayright MCP: LLM calls the MCP, the MCP triggers standard playright functions.\n\nFile System MCP: LLM calls the FS MCP, the MCP triggers file sytem actions.\n\nYou are already used to working with MCPs, most known AIs have them built in.\n\nFor example : \"Draw me and my dog in Ghibli style \" ==> ChatGPT (a text model), calls DALL-E (and image model), through OpenAI's version of MCP, the MCP gets the output back from DALL E and passes it to ChatGPT, which sends it to the frontend (this might not be the actual execution pipeline, but it was to explain the idea).\n\nYou can actually simulate this with POSTMAN right now, go install an MCP server and then add an MCP request on POSTMAN, you can simply query it instead of the LLM.",

        "body": "I would love to see this fixed, but given that `Cursor` isn't open source I doubt anyone other than `Anysphere` can fix it. Though they might be able to come up with a `root cause` or a `workaround`.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour `ptyHost` errors are more likely related to `terminal` panes than the general UI. You also mention a clue that it has happened since `0.50`. So analyze a version of `Cursor` before `0.50.0` like `0.49.6`. The analyze `0.50.0` and look for differences.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI  am on also `Linux`, in my case `Fedora 42`. I see this issue as choppy input when typing in the prompt input box. It just seems to come and go randomly for me. Also sometimes it is so bad it is super annoying, and sometimes it is only mildly annoying.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI suspect it has something that is trying to process your prompt text in real-time. This could be things like auto-complete or them literally streaming your prompt character by character to an API for analysis. It could be based on the responsiveness of one of their APIs, and hence also based on their load in that moment. This might explain, from my own experience, the randomness of it. This could be quite the rabbithole.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYour single biggest hurdle is reproducibility.  If you can't consistently reproduce it, and also get others to be able to reproduce it consistently is that you could chase your tail for a long long time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou might have better luck reducing the number of things to chase down by running `Cursor` in a VM. This is also a case where `Linux` is going to be easier to debug than `macOS`, because `Apple` makes running `macOS` in a VM a pain in the ass. You can standardize the hardware, and cut out things like certain graphics chips and drivers. It would also make it much easier without major breakage to your normal setup to try different `Linux` distributions, [versions](https://github.com/oslook/cursor-ai-downloads) of `Cursor`, removing all `VSCode` extensions, `Xorg` vs `Wayland`, versions of the `Linux` kernel, `/sys` settings, `/proc` settings, etc. You could also intentionally choke it for performance by limiting the number of cores it has access to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou could also try setting the `nice` of the process. You could play with [Kernel preemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_preemption). You could investigate [process scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler). You could investigate [i/o scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noop_scheduler). You could investigate [real-time Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PREEMPT_RT).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI can tell you that you might find `> Developer: Toggle Developer Tools` in the top center search box useful. Especially the `Elements`, `Network`, and `Performance` tabs. It basically gives you `Chrome` style `Developer Tools` given that `Cursor` is based on `VSCode`, `VSCode` is based on `Electron`, and `Electron` is based on `Chromium`.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso since it is based on `VSCode` it could be some really stupid like a bug in `VSCode` that upstream is already fixed, but `Cursor` is a fork based on an older version that may be missing some fix.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou might also find `strace` useful for monitoring system calls, especially file operations. If you want to go really deep into the system look into [SystemTap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemTap). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou might find tools like [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy) useful for monitoring HTTPS traffic to APIs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI bet if you asked some models they could give you even more tools and ideas to chase. Like becoming an expert on debugging `VSCode`.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Good luck!**",

If it persists, run strace -tt -f -e trace=futex,ioctl ‑p $(pgrep -f cursor) and watch for a thread stuck in FUTEX_WAIT; that points to either a missing heartbeat or GPU driver lock. Comparing perf top on 0.49.6 vs 0.50 will show if a new symbol suddenly dominates.

It could be one cross-platform issue. It could be one per platform, `macOS` and `Linux`. It could be multiple issues per platform. It could be one primary issue, with many secondary issues that seem the same but are rare edge cases. This is part of why I said we have nothing till we have an issue multiple people can reproduce.\n\nAn example, I thought `Cursor` was directly causing system crashes a while back by running the system out of `VRAM`. In reality, it seems like yes `Cursor` is a heavy user of `VRAM`, but the bigger issue was a combination of the `Nvidia` drivers and `Wayland` under `Linux`.

But it’s Linux and to be fair, everything has bugs and issues. Personally I do think it has something to do with Wayland (because Wayland seems to make everything bug out) but I have no confirmation of this yet. Something something text rendering something memory issues something something. I’m no expert so I’m probably totally wrong, but I’m super happy that Linux support is going to continue. I probably wouldn’t have switched unless so many people explicitly told me to jump on the Linux boat now and get good while the getting is really starting to get going. Plus I really didn’t want to use slcan for a CAN bus project I am developing and it’s my understanding using socketcan on native Linux is how Jesus intended when he wrote the good word.",

Record a 60-sec perf profile plus chrome://tracing export while Cursor sits idle; if the stall still appears you’ve ruled out Wayland, VRAM, and exotic schedulers. Next flip only one switch per run: Wayland flag, Nvidia passthrough, PREEMPTRT kernel, etc., cloning the VM each time. Track GPU and VRAM with nvidia-smi dmon or radeontop; a flatline during lockup points back to the event loop, a spike screams driver. If it’s event-loop, attaching node --inspect and sampling async stacks exposes the promise chain without rebuilding Electron. If it’s driver, --disable-gpu-compositing or ELECTRONOZONE_PLATFORM=x11 is a quick workaround until Anysphere rebases onto a newer Chromium. Handing them a qcow2 that reproduces in two clicks forces the fix faster.",

I was just trying to confirm if I got it right, for it seems like the same \"bug\" plaguing nearly all AI-driven interfaces these days: ChatGPT, Grok, Windsurf, Cursor, etc. The problem kicks in when the chat window gets too big, and everything starts slowing down, then slows even more, until it completely freezes, locking up even keyboard and mouse inputs.\n\nAs I mentioned, this happens with ChatGPT too, for example. Just keep chatting until the conversation gets so massive that everything starts to freeze. But this only happens on web and desktop apps, not on mobile. My hunch is that this is deliberate, to discourage long conversations that cost companies more to maintain. Since long chats are less common on mobile, it seems like companies used optimized threading to handle this.\n\nIF this is your situation, regrettably, I doubt anyone here can fully resolve this, as the defect might be ingrained in the server-client framework. Only stopgap measures are feasible, such as launching new conversations or switching to alternatives that handle this better, like Claude Code or custom-built solutions. However, as you noted, if this persists even in fresh, clean conversations, your issue might originate from a completely different source. I’d recommend reinstalling Cursor from the ground up in a clean environment to identify whether the problem stems from Cursor or the project itself.",

Also, creating and tracking the branch is all taken care of on the add command.\n\nI’m not really sure what there is to be anxious about with this strategy?

With how quickly I can work with Cursor, I was opening 3-4 PRs a day and waiting on approvals for them all. Imagine repeating that process constantly for 4 different branches. Sometimes by the time I got one branch checked back out, I had received comments on another. It got to the point where I wouldn’t have more than 3 PRs open at a time. \n\nNow, switching is as easy as switching windows and I can work on almost infinite things at once with very little pain of switching. Also I don’t forget about long running side efforts that are outside of my feature work. I’m currently experimenting with parallelizing our test examples and it takes a lot of research and trial and error and I would never work on it if I had to stop my other work and switch to a branch every time. But now I just jump to that window in the morning and kick Cursor off on some task I’ll check on later",

On June 16th I signed up for Cursor Pro to try it out and was charged the expected $22.  I used Cursor for a day or two on small project mostly with the model set to \"default\".  That wasn't really great so I flipped the \"MAX mode\" button and started trying out some of the MAX only models.  I used Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus a bit.  I used Gemini 2.5 Pro quite a bit.  Since I flipped the MAX mode switch I was expecting to see some additional charges.... but I have not.  And in fact, when I go to the Cursor website and look at my account it still says \"Usage-based pricing is off\".  I thought MAX mode was the same as \"usage based pricing\" but now I'm not so sure?  Does this make sense to anyone?",

Again may well be blocked on a company machine\n* Ubuntu on a bootable USB stick. Might not boot on a company laptop and you won’t be in your work laptop OS at all \n* browser based IDE . Eg you can use vs code in a browser. Either use it with a cursor like extension or your regular Claude/chatgpt/gemini account copy past style. Honestly I think this is your best bet. \n* other browser based, cursor like tools. These would be better than the previous option but I’m not aware of a good one yet.",

Just randomly in the middle of the night they may decided to take away 80% of what you have already paid for and hope you don't notice.  (As in the night a few weeks ago when lots of people blew through their whole month of credits without be notified the plan changed)\n\nThey are acting in bad faith and actively modifying what is included in the plan you paid for without telling you they have done so. No platform does that. Its a shitty thing to do.\n\nImagine if your email service said  “send 10000 emails for 20/mo” so you sign up.  But on email 500 it said you were out of emails. So you go to reddit to see if anyone else has problems only to find out that without emailing you to tell you the email service is now changed to “unlimited for 20/mo!” accept it only works 1 out of every 5 hours… or you can upgrade to “super unlimited for 200/mo!” accept it only works 1 out of every 2 hours… thats what Cursor did.",

The infrastructure engineers are probably working overtime just to keep things running.

GPU availability is still a huge constraint.\n\nThat said, it’s still incredibly frustrating. I think everything you mentioned is spot on. And on top of that, I suspect even the model responsible for applying edits or refinements after the primary model generates code is getting throttled.\n\nAll I want is transparency — and a usage-based pricing tier that guarantees the best possible quality.

So I use it more of a companion in that, I know what I want it to write, and it just writes pretty much all the code, which is where I feel guilty. I do jump in and correct things myself ever now and again so I don't have to waste a request on something simple, but I have refined my rules so well (IMO) that it write near perfect code 95% of the time!\n\nI see Cursor getting quite a bit of stick but I am still super happy with it. It will hang sometimes as its writing code but eventually it picks itself back up and continues, which is still 100x fasted than I could ever write code!",

The implementation goes in autopilot.\n\nBut, and it’s a BIG BUT, it couldn’t work so well without me, the humble human in the loop, preparing small and incremental stories that are rather easy to pick up and write, given its immense knowledge.\n\nI do most of the thinking, Cursor does most of the writing (and also the reading of external docs)",

Using APM, Super Claude, Mcps, I was making phased MECE plans and distributing them across parallel agents. I created some complex mostly working, tested shit in like two days… but then I started reading about how the caps work. If you want it to last all month you can essentially run one agent less than 2 5 hour sessions per day. You get throttled when you get to 50. And every single terminal instance of Claude counts towards your 50 monthly sessions. That means with 8 sessions running there you are bound to get rate limited for the month in a few days. Is this not the case? Or did you just subscribe and start doing this not realizing you will probably get cut off within a few days of use working like that?",

I cant even use a shell script to unset them, I have to manually unset the env vars one by one. I don't have a .cursor folder or .vscode folder with project settings. \n\nI do have .env.local and .env.prod and .env. The root .env only has dev settings, same with local. Somehow all of them are being combined but end up with prod connection strings. \n\nIt doesnt happen when I run npm run dev from a seperate terminal only happens on the integrated ide terminal. and it seems to only be happening for this project. Seems like a very unsafe bug. If i open it in vscode everything works as normal. \n\n\n\nAnyone encountered this before?",

    "selftext": "Hey gang!\n\nHoping you guys can help me with an ongoing and frustrating issue. I have been trying to run Figma's MCP server as an MCP protocol within Cursor. Followed every tutorial I can find and still there is a roadblock preventing Cursor from communicating with or seeing the Figma file. Cursor is reporting:\n\n>The server is definitely running, but I don't have the right tools in my current toolset to connect to MCP servers or make requests to 127.0.0.1:3845. My available tools are:\n\n>File operations (read, search, list)\n\n>Web search\n\n>Terminal commands\n\n>Code analysis\n\n>I don't have MCP client tools or the ability to make HTTP requests to your local Figma MCP server.\n\nI have added the tool with url [http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse](http://127.0.0.1:3845/sse) to the MCP server list in Cursor and the Tool itself just reports \"Loading tools\".\n\nFigma's MCP is running and reports an endpoint. Gemini has analyzed is as:\n\n>Even though your Figma server is correctly broadcasting its endpoint via SSE, and your Cursor `mcp.json` is correctly pointing to it, the **AI agent** ***within*** **Cursor is reporting that it lacks the internal capability or permission to establish the actual connection and fetch data from that local address.**\n\nDoes anyone know why Cursor can't fetch data from the server it can see? Is there something I'm missing in the tool context? Any one having this issue? Thanks so much.",

    "title": "My experience using the new Ultra Plan",
    "selftext": "I agree that the regular plan is a bit too restrictive and hits limits too early. It's kind of a rip off, imo. I'd be miserable using it.\n\nI upgraded to Ultra immediately when it was offered because I was previously being billed by usage and I'd use MAX and I'd see new $20 cursor charges being charged every couple hours. I'd get stressed and switch back to normal mode only for it to fuck everything up because it's just not as smart as MAX mode. It made my Cursor experience pretty terrible.\n\nBut now, I know exactly how much I'm spending each month and the $20 Cursor charge push notifications don't give me anxiety. My highest bill was around $450 for a month and averaged right around $300/mo.\n\nI have yet to hit any limits and I've been using MAX 100% of the time. I've just started to duplicate my workspace so I can work on the same project in two windows on different parts of the app at the same time, so I don't spend so much time waiting around and I still have yet to hit any limits.\n\nIMO, the Ultra Plan is awesome.\n\nTo those of you who wanna be like, \"You're the reason why they get away with charging so much,\" ...yeah, well, I'm sorry. It's worth it to me if I can get more done in less time and ultimately have more free time to do other stuff.\n\nI'm not paying any more than this, though, Cursor, so don't go raising prices on me or walking back limits, etc...",

    "title": "Thinking of pairing Claude Code with Cursor Pro — worth it?",
    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m currently using Cursor Pro as my main tool for writing, debugging, and enhancing prompts in a medium-sized project. I’ve been happy with it overall, but the rate limits are becoming a bottleneck I regularly hit the cap.\n\nI’ve already tried GitHub Copilot Pro (with GPT-4.1) and Claude 4 inside VS Code, but honestly… they were pretty bad. Neither could fix simple bugs or handle multi-file logic cleanly.\n\nSo now I’m considering adding Claude Code (the CLI tool) on top of Cursor Pro. I’ve seen tons of comments like *“switched to Claude Code and never looked back”*, but I have zero hands-on experience with it.\n\n🔹 A few key questions:\n\nIs Claude Code actually better than Cursor for things like debugging, testing, or refactoring across a whole repo? Is the CLI usable day-to-day? Can I just run it inside the terminal panel in Cursor or VS Code? Are the prompt limits (10–40 every 5 hours on Pro) more or less generous than Cursor’s? Has anyone here used both — and stuck with both? Or did you fully switch?\n\nI’m leaning toward keeping **Cursor Pro** as my main IDE and using Claude Code CLI as a fallback or for heavier tasks  but open to switching if it really blows Cursor away. Appreciate any insights 🙏",

If your code is well organzied 100 will do. I see lot of really experienced folks using the 100.\n\nWith cc ive been able to get significantly more done in terms of the smaller annoying things, getting github actions setup, build scripts, cleanup and then fixing a lot of backlog etc while only hand coding the real differentiators and new features (if its simple this also goes to cc). \n\nIf you are solo and using it ~15 hours a day 25days a month on pure ROI its 💯 worth it atleast until the time cost of software takes to adjust to how cheap it is to write stuff today.",

    "selftext": "If you are using multiple LLMs for different coding tasks, now you can set your usage preferences once like \"code analysis -> Gemini 2.5pro\", \"code generation -> claude-sonnet-3.7\" and route to LLMs that offer most help for particular coding scenarios. Video is quick preview of the functionality currently with RooCode, wish there was an easy way to plug this in with Cursor. \n\nBtw the whole idea around task/usage based routing emerged when we saw developers in the same team used different models because they preferred different models based on subjective preferences. For example, I might want to use GPT-4o-mini for fast code understanding but use Sonnet-3.7 for code generation. Those would be my \"preferences\". And current routing approaches don't really work in real-world scenarios. For example:\n\n“Embedding-based” (or simple intent-classifier) routers sound good on paper—label each prompt via embeddings as “support,” “SQL,” “math,” then hand it to the matching model—but real chats don’t stay in their lanes. Users bounce between topics, task boundaries blur, and any new feature means retraining the classifier. The result is brittle routing that can’t keep up with multi-turn conversations or fast-moving product scopes.\n\nPerformance-based routers swing the other way, picking models by benchmark or cost curves. They rack up points on MMLU or MT-Bench yet miss the human tests that matter in production: “Will Legal accept this clause?” “Does our support tone still feel right?” Because these decisions are subjective and domain-specific, benchmark-driven black-box routers often send the wrong model when it counts.\n\n**Arch-Router skips both pitfalls by routing on** ***preferences you write in plain language***\\*\\*.\\*\\* Drop rules like “contract clauses → GPT-4o” or “quick travel tips → Gemini-Flash,” and our 1.5B auto-regressive router model maps prompt along with the context to your routing policies—no retraining, no sprawling rules that are encoded in if/else statements. Co-designed with Twilio and Atlassian, it adapts to intent drift, lets you swap in new models with a one-liner, and keeps routing logic in sync with the way you actually judge quality.\n\n**Specs**\n\n* **Tiny footprint** – 1.5 B params → runs on one modern GPU (or CPU while you play).\n* **Plug-n-play** – points at any mix of LLM endpoints; adding models needs *zero* retraining.\n* **SOTA query-to-policy matching** – beats bigger closed models on conversational datasets.\n* **Cost / latency smart** – push heavy stuff to premium models, everyday queries to the fast ones.\n\nExclusively available in Arch (the AI-native proxy for agents): [https://github.com/katanemo/archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw)  \n🔗 Model + code: [https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B)  \n📄 Paper / longer read: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655)",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m trying to figure out if it’s possible to integrate Cursor IDE with my Claude desktop app on macOS—without using an Anthropic API key.\n\nI do have a Claude Pro account and the Claude desktop app installed. What I want is to have Cursor send chat requests about my codebase directly to my local Claude app (or through my Claude account), so I can interact with Claude inside Cursor—without needing to plug in a separate API key.\n\nHas anyone managed to set this up? Is there a way to configure MCP to bridge Cursor with the Claude desktop app or Claude web account? \n\nIdeally I want Claude to understand my local project context from within Cursor. Would love any pointers, config examples, or confirmation that this is (or isn’t) possible yet. Thanks!",

But I'll tell you from experience that Claude Desktop has a hard time working with large files locally and you'll exceed the limits quickly.\n\nIf the root of this is you wanting to use your paid Claude account and not pay for a second account through Cursor, then I would recommend switching over to Claude Code and use that within Cursor or VS Code.",

I'm not negatively impacted by the new model because I use a lot of different tools at the same time, so I don't need a lot of cursor requests, but the rollout was definately botched. \n\nAn easy way would have been to have the new model only apply to new users and just grandfather existing ones for a year or something. I'm pretty confident they'll tweak and polish the new system until its adequate, but that will take a bit and people will be rightfully so upset until it happens.\n\nPeople are losing their minds over rate limits on the Claude Code side of things too.

Know what you want to build and research everything that can be related to it. In my case, I use chatgpt (free web version) to discuss things. Last time, I inquire chat gpt regarding rust, tauri, and svelte. We have a decent back and forth of discussion as I ask questions upon questions of anything I can think of and to clarify some things with the AI. I then downloaded our conversation to an .md file and feed it to claude ai (free web version) I instructed claude to create a PRD and a roadmap based on our chatgpt conversation (attached). Which in turn I will use in cursor to start coding. \n(Of course you have to read and review those md files, for learning and understanding your project). ",

To do this you need to make sure you write really good prompts and don't go too far too quickly.   \n\nWithout being able to spot them there will be security holes, and things that are bad from a tech pov in there.  If you want to make serious money out of something you will still need a pretty senior dev to come and fix that stuff up.  But the advantage this way round is you can test your idea first and then invest in the tech when you think it'll work. \n\nAlso, think about your stack.  Some things are inherently better from a \"what's the worst it can do\" PoV than others.  I use a supabase back end which makes a lot of the data security checking for me (who is a dev) much easier than, for example, just letting the AI run away with a normal data layer and patched authentication over the top.",

Your message limit will reset every 5 hours. We call these 5-hour segments a “session” and they start with your first message to Claude. If your conversations are relatively short, with the Max plan at 5x more usage, you can expect to send at least 225 messages every 5 hours, and with the Max plan at 20x more usage, at least 900 messages every 5 hours, often more depending on message length, conversation length, and Claude's current capacity.

    "selftext": "Any idea why CLaude Claude (using Claude 4.0 Sonnet Max mode) lies about the work done against the requirements? My workflow is to first have Claude generate a comprehensive markdown plan for a significant task. I then instruct it to execute that plan. However, it typically only completes about 30% of the work before incorrectly stating that the entire task is finished, often with celebratory emojis like rockets (🚀) and stars (✨).\n\nTo make progress, I have to repeatedly ask it to perform a step-by-step assessment against the original markdown document. Only then does it acknowledge the work is incomplete and continues. This cycle of partial work, false completion, and manual verification can take 6-7 iterations to finish a single task.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? I'm trying to determine if this is:\n\n1. A known behavioral issue with the Claude 4.0 model itself?\n2. A result of how Cursor is managing context or imposing token limits?",

Overall system architecture* *2. Your specific responsibilities* *3. Integration points with other components* *4. Coding standards and patterns to follow* *5. Current implementation status* *Begin implementation following the established patterns.*\n\n**The Self-Enriching Loop** We launch a blank slate agent with just a key to see its tasks and query the RAG agent. The agent completely understands the project and its role through this self-enriching context loop:\n\nBlank slate → enriches itself with project context and best practices → completes its tasks → adds new context back to the project RAG\n\nIt's a continuous cycle where each agent makes the system smarter for the next one.",

It's barely any different from Claude in Cursor or from Copilot. The parts where it makes mistakes, it makes the same mistakes. The results it produces are the same. The web interface looks the same too. Plus, the part I really don't like is that it doesn't support Windows.

But this couldn’t be a ploy to get Cursor customers to switch to Claude Code, now could it?\n\nEdit: Also look at the subject of this post. “I tried the Claude Code plan for $20 and had a surprising result.” This is a text book bait and hook technique taught to social media interns. Almost as bad as “here are my top 10 reasons Claude Code sucks! You won’t believe number 7!!”",

As well as learning your codebase because it saw some relevant parts when writing the previous feature, where Cursor is a lot more likely to forget or hallucinate the bits. In Cursor it is much more useful to start new chats for every feature.  \nClaude Code will work a lot better on large projects comparatively, especially if you do stuff like tell it to write doc files.\n\n> considering the time required to set it up and the complexity of manipulating it compared to Cursor, \n\nUh, it is pretty simple to set up? Windows ups the challenge slightly, but a ton of developers already have WSL.  \nAnd it is basically as simple as Cursor. You open it in your terminal for some repo and ask it to do something. You can do `/init` to let it collect information about your repo so it works better, but that's a one line command and you just wait.  \n\n> not to mention the price is outrageous for me.\n\nThis is where I agree. The price comparison makes Cursor a better option for people paying $20 a month. But if you're willing to pay $100 then it is a good investment imo.

Very consistent documents with business context, user personas, priorities, what's in and out of scope, BDD stories, technical requirements like package specs, testing, and performance criteria etc.\n\nTM pulls it apart and provides a well structured and prioritised task list. Each task can be expanded into as many sub tasks as needed to keep each piece of work you give the agent small and focused so it doesn't run off with the leash chasing clouds.\n\nIt's great for doing the majority of the legwork so you don't need to vibe your way through each time you want to move forward - all the prompting is ready to go in a format and specificity the agent can use efficently. You're just tasking the agent to run taskmaster: verify the current subtask is complete wrt the requirements, telling it to complete something it might have skipped over in a tasks, begin the next subtask etc.\n\nWe're working on a relatively small monorepo, and our current method is initialising TM at the package root so it only has to work with a smaller context. Won't work for everything, but it's working so far. A rules doc that indexes what the agent might need to know outside of that package - without it having to load all that other code into the context - helps.\n\n  \nedit to add - Claude Code seems to be **very** good at being it's own taskmaster and keeping itself on track. A benefit of using TM with CC could be reducing the context and toek usage throughout more complex sets of work. Haven't actually tried this as yet.",

Eion is a shared memory storage system that provides unified knowledge graph capabilities for AI agent systems. Think of it as the \"Google Docs of AI Agents\" that connects multiple AI agents together, allowing them to share context, memory, and knowledge in real-time.\n\nWhen building multi-agent systems, I kept running into the same issues: limited memory space, context drifting, and knowledge quality dilution. Eion tackles these issues by:\n\n* Unifying API that works for single LLM apps, AI agents, and complex multi-agent systems \n* No external cost via in-house knowledge extraction + all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding \n* PostgreSQL + pgvector for conversation history and semantic search \n* Neo4j integration for temporal knowledge graphs \n\nWould love to get feedback from the community! What features would you find most useful? Any architectural decisions you'd question?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/z0pi280pyq9f1.gif\n\n\\+ we added mcp and a console that can be more intuitive than python sdk for better ux!\n\nWebsite: [https://www.eiondb.com](https://www.eiondb.com)  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/eiondb/eion](https://github.com/eiondb/eion)  \nDocs: [https://pypi.org/project/eiondb/](https://pypi.org/project/eiondb/)",

        "body": "TBH, I’m more concerned about the complexity of maintaining a VSCode fork with all the dependencies under the hood (Electron / Chromium, NodeJS, typescript extensions, etc…) than with AI competitors.\n\nThere have already been quite a few things that are noticeably [broken in Cursor][1], some of which I’d consider show-stopper type breakages (especially [this][5]).  Not to mention the further extensions marketplace split introduced between the Microsoft one, the `marketplace.cursorapi.com` version (mirror?), and of course [OpenVSX][2].\n\nIt's hard enough to get a set of extensions installed and working well together.  Add to that the inconsistencies introduced by yet another forked marketplace, and those already created by Microsoft’s atypical approach to Open Source + proprietary extensions (e.g. `ms-python.vscode-pylance`, `GitHub.copilot-chat`) which seems to be a combination of both proper OSS-licensed software mixed with non-OSS licensed release packages, including some [OpenWashing][3] and proprietary blobs in various states of broken when you get into the details and kick the tires.  It's rather disappointing really, because opening up the code for those extensions would help the community to fix a lot of those problems.\n\nOther options like [`void`][4] now exist that are fully open source and also offer an AI-provider agnostic way to attach various AI models, and MCP tools into the IDE via APIs, including support for attaching to locally running models.  This seems to be a better maintainable avenue in the long term, rather than suffering from vendor lock-in and ratcheting subscription fees.\n\n[1]: https://forum.cursor.com/t/no-native-titlebar-in-linux-with-window-titlebarstyle-set-to-native/71071/12?u=trinitronx\n[2]: https://open-vsx.org/\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openwashing\n[4]: https://github.com/voideditor/void/\n[5]: https://www.reddit.com/r/cursor/s/Av45sPmN22",

I tried giving a similar prompt to cursor and it did great for the first few files.

Signed up for `Claude Code` with the $20 plan.\n - I don't love it, but do like it. \n - Doesn't have `Cursor`'s auto-complete, not that I can't use it in `Cursor` or load the `Supermaven` extension.\n - The $20 plan goes reasonably far, but still isn't as good as `Cursor`'s old pricing with 500 fast requests and unlimited slow requests.\n - I wouldn't go all-in with `Claude Code`. I believe in the need to choose a different model or provider when they fail to get the job done.\n3. I haven't tried `Gemini CLI` yet, and it is free, for now. But I don't expect it to stay free, and `Claude Sonnet 4` is on average better than `Gemini 2.5 Pro`.\n3. `GitHub Copilot` is having the same kind of issues with `Cursor`, aka degrading service and pricing.\n4. `Windsurf` doesn't have `Claude Sonnet 4` with non-API pricing.\n5. `Trae` doesn't have `Linux` support.\n6. `RooCode`/`Cline` are too pricey with API pricing. You can use both with `Claude Code` for a slightly better interface, but still has the same rate limits.\n7. `Augment Code` isn't a choice in my book. It has no choosing of the model, and that is a dealbreaker for me.\n8. `Zed` is slightly better in that they let you select the model, but they are only `Anthropic` models. It seems like it would be better to go to the source, `Anthropic`.\n9. `Codex` has `OpenAI` models only. They are in general in third place behind `Google` and `Anthropic`. Not to say they are useless. Just not the first choice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe solution might just end up being something like `Claude Code`+`Gemini CLI`+`Codex` all with $20 plans. Then just round-robin them. Still not the ideal solution. 95% of the time I just want to use `Claude Code`, and with the $20 plan I will hit rate limits.The ideal would be something like a $50 unlimited `Claude Code` plan, $5 `Gemini CLI` plan, and a $5 `Codex` plan. One can dream.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnother idea would be go with the `Claude Code` $100 plan, and then just use the freebies of `o3` and `Gemini` when needed. `Google`'s and `OpenAI`'s rate limits will likely be annoying, but might be livable when it only happens 5% of the time. You might be able to combine free sources like `AIStudio`, `OpenRouter`, and `Gemini CLI`.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYet another way would be just to pay API prices for the 5% problems. I would expect the costs to probably be in the ballpark of $20-$50 a month. It would all come down to luck and careful prompting.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been working on a concept aimed at transforming how developers interact with their workflows and tools. The idea revolves around creating a memory and automation layer that lives locally alongside AI kernels think of it as a personal assistant that remembers your context, tools, and preferences, rather than trying to know everything. What makes this different: Always-on, local-first operation for privacy and low latency Complete sovereignty over your data and workflows Deep, actionable integration with developer tools (editors, version control, CI/CD) to automate repetitive tasks, surface relevant context, and provide traceability across multi-feature projects Designed for real project continuity: persistent memory, version awareness, and workflow automation not just chat history I’m still in the early stages and haven’t shipped anything yet, but I’m excited about the potential here. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the challenges or opportunities you see in this space. What would you want from a developer-centric AI assistant that truly understands your workflow and project history? I’m sharing this to get feedback and connect with others passionate about AI and developer tooling. Looking forward to your insights!",

    "selftext": "Let me be blunt: Cursor's leadership just made one of the most tone-deaf business decisions I've witnessed in the developer tools space, and it's going to cost them everything they've built.\n\nThe recent plan changes aren't just bad policy, they're insulting. Cursor's management apparently believes developers are too stupid to notice when our service gets degraded mid-contract, or too apathetic to care when a company violates basic principles of fair dealing.\n\nI don't care if they need to raise prices. Plenty of companies do.\n\nWhat Cursor did was implement a stealth price increase by degrading existing service while claiming it was just optimization for different workflows.\n\nThis is exactly how promising developer tools die.\n\nCursor's only sustainable advantage was developer trust and early-mover loyalty. They literally had developers evangelizing their product for free, creating content, building communities.\n\nAnd they threw it away for what? A few percentage points on quarterly revenue?\n\nAI coding assistance will be commoditized within 18 months. The companies that survive won't be those with the best algorithms, they'll be those developers actually want to use long-term.\n\nDid Cursor's leadership seriously think they could pull a fast one on the most technically sophisticated customer base in software?\n\nThe arrogance is staggering.\n\nThey had lightning in a bottle. They chose to smash the bottle for spare change. Now they get to find out what that decision costs.",

Developers willing to part ways with that much cash. That said, while a lot of the value could be from the foundation models (think pass through revenue), it’s still the wrapper on top that makes it easy to use. \n\nPeople on annual plans getting a switcharoo is not okay. People on monthly plans don’t have any leg if plans change. \n\nThe team is immature, so they will break a lot of things in the pursuit of optimizing for growth. \n\nBut I’ll also say, even mature and senior teams are not immune and get this wrong. As an example, Amazon introduced ads to Prime Video and asked for $4/month or something to remove them, including to annual plan customers.\n\nYou can always try and reason with them, get a full refund for what you paid, or a pro-rated refund based on time left, a partial refund to reflect the inferior plan value. \n\nThat said, this market seems to be very quick to change where developers pick the best offering. The switching costs are low and currently nobody has an entrenching strategy that I’ve seen. Not even GitHub.\n\nIt’s interesting to see how little Google and GitLab have invested to capture share here.",

Or would it become more efficient to just send a follow up prompt to the AI in which it cleans up the mistakes?\n\nLong term, Cursor's best advantage was actually their relationship with devs, and IMO they've now bottled it.

Their business model is actually bundling and reselling tokens and that does not provide them with any competitive advantage. I’d say that their proposition is worse than I.e. OpenRouter which is much more transparent. \n\nThey just capitalized on being very early in the game, a moment in time where people (investors included) were really clueless about the whole landscape that was emerging. I think Cursor did that part very successfully, but from now on there is nothing innovative or worth investing in their operation.\n\nPS: I was invited to their physical meeting in my city recently. It was a total let down. The presentations from the guests were silly and the talk and AMA from their office in San Francisco was so shallow I cringed.

At a certain point I downloaded Trae which is a copy of Cursor that allows you to use it for as long as the daily free use of any LLM out there allows you to, I did most of my research on Claude, code on Trae and eventually used its chat to go over small things or a final review.\n\nI did read a few angry users here on Reddit explaining the scam they played on the early adopters who suddenly saw bills of hundreds of dollars popping up in their credit cards from Cursor and that a change was done in the contract without the agreement of the users.

Unless you meant a <1 exponent.\n\nKeep in mind that roughly linear improvements/saturation on coding benchmarks generally translate to linear increases in percentage of problems solved, which represents a *decreasing* marginal improvement. That doesn't necessarily mean linear decreases in errors (if you go from 5 errors to 0 on a problem, your accuracy only goes up by 1 problem on most benches) but there's no strong evidence of exponentially decreasing error rates.\n\nNo anecdotal evidence, either, btw; when people say Sonnet 4 beats Sonnet 3.7 etc, that's primarily because there's a large utility benefit from going from 99% error free to 99.9% error free on any given problem. That doesn't mean it was a larger error dropoff than say going from 90% accuracy to 99% accuracy with a previous generational improvement.",

The purpose of this exercise is to help me, a learning developer, understand what these pages are, what they do, and how they can be improved. Tailor it to someone who's just beginning to understand the technical underpinnings of this application. Use plain language where possible. Again, you are not permitted to write any code, but only leave comments in the code.",

This has to be a joke so i literally can't even use cursor now unless i gonna spend $200 a month. At least with usage based i could still use it. I just don't know why eveything is so complicated. Like unlimited plan $20, but then you get unlimited more for $60 and then even more unlimited for $200. This makes no sense.

    "selftext": "I’ve been a long-time supporter of Cursor AI, and I have to be honest: the previous Pro plan was far better for users like me. With 500 fast requests per month, I knew exactly what I was paying for and how much I was using. That clarity was valuable.\n\nThe new “unlimited” model may sound good on paper, but in practice, it lacks transparency. I don’t care about the word “unlimited” if I can’t use the product the way I need.\n\nBack then, I could choose to use all 500 requests in a single intense day of work—and that was my choice. Now, I feel more limited, not less.\n\nPlease listen to your core users. You’ve built something great, but don’t lose the trust and loyalty you’ve earned by removing what made the experience feel fair and flexible in the first place.\n\nWe don’t need marketing fluff. We need predictable, reliable access—just like before.",

Then once that's gone, it seems like you're on some replenishing time based quota. 1-2 hours later, you can do maybe 5-20 Opus calls, then maxed out again.\n\nCC is session and usage based. 50 sessions a month (maybe soft cap, we dont really know yet). Each session is a 5 hour window. 1 request in that window and that's an active session. You have 5 hours to use it or lose it.  Hitting opus hard you can deplete your limits and hit the 50% consumption limit, then it switches to Sonnet.\n\nI've used 42 sessions since 12th June. So I'm on track to pass the 50 limit next week.  Will see if I can feel (or ideally measure with ccusage etc) the limits.\n\nSo comparing the two, I think CC wins over Cursor if your objective is to exclusively use Opus.",

This information is somewhat hidden in the dashboard—the API returns the data, but the cursor doesn't display it yet.\n\nWithout installing any extensions, you can get a basic idea by following these steps:\n\n1. Go to the dashboard's usage section.\n2. Open Chrome Developer Tools.\n3. Go to the **Network** tab.\n4. Refresh the page.\n5. Enter `get-monthly-invoice` in the filter, then select it.\n6. Click the **Response** tab to view the detailed usage data in JSON format.\n\nAnd below is the screenshot of the chrome extension I just let sonnet-4(normal mode) in cursor write based on this API data.\n\n[My extension](https://preview.redd.it/rh77s1u4re9f1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3824a3ee812df9018b9b2654662d5cec7077b7)\n\n**Please note:** The first six requests were made while creating this extension. 😄 Now that I’ve refined the prompt, it should require fewer requests to build the extension. If you’re interested, I can share the prompt! After all, is an open prompt even better than open source?\n\nEdit: Here's the repo: [https://github.com/xiangz19/cursor\\_usage\\_detail](https://github.com/xiangz19/cursor_usage_detail) — the prompt is included as well.",

I pipe that JSON into a small Python script that logs daily usage, then push the logs to Grafana so the spike graphs pop right out. Postman collections work great for hitting the endpoint on a schedule-set the bearer token as an environment variable and throw it in a monitor. Insomnia’s templating makes it easy to swap between workspaces if you juggle multiple orgs. After tinkering with both, APIWrapper.ai ended up handling the cron and storage for me without extra glue code. Keeping an eye on that raw data saved me from a runaway chain-of-thought prompt last week. Trust the invoice endpoint if you want the real story.",

Check out my other posts: once you hit the rate limit, it can become much easier to hit it again.\n\nI've been using Opus-4-Max 1–2 times per day and Sonnet-4-Max 2–3 times per day. With the old pricing, that wasn’t possible. However, even with these two Opus requests, they didn’t fully solve my issues. I usually end up using Gemini Web to plan and then let Sonnet-4 handle the implementation.\n\nNow I can use Sonnet-4's thinking mode more freely, since its cost and compute usage aren't doubled compared to the non-thinking version. Under the old pricing, the thinking mode counted as two requests, while the non-thinking version only counted as one. \n\nI also feel more free to interrupt the agent or make additional requests now. With the old pricing, you could use tools like mcp-feedback, but there were no automatic checkpoints, and it tended to disrupt the flow. Personally, I still prefer to chat in the regular way.",

The other active window I have running doesn't have this limit message.  So at least if you do hit the limit and you have a task going, Cursor doesn't switch the model on you and attempt to continue, unlike others do.\n\nEdit: 64 more calls later and the active window also got the rate limited msg.",

Then after just like 5-6 requests of 4-sonnet-thinking I got limited (after not using it for a full 24 hours). Then I switched to opus-max (which counts as a different model) to get rate limited after like 5-6 too. Then switched to o3, which in this case did a worse job at a slower pace. Later that day I uses 4-sonnet-thinking again, to get hit again after only 3 or so requests.\n\nThis shit is really bad. Now I almost was tempted to buy Pro+ for $60. But my sanity took over and asked: why the fuck do I have to pay a FULL $60 if I ALSO paid $20 already?? An upgrade should be $40 for the remainder of this month. So I backend out and turned on billing, to pay $0.44 for ONE fucking 4-sonnet-thinking request.\n\nAt that point I just opted out of the new system all together. And this is where this shit is even more busted: I HAD 380 REQUESTS LEFT OF THE 500! Their whole administration us a clown show. I will be keeping Cursor Pro for $20 and just pay $0.04 per request and not get cockblocked every 5 messages. Because if Pro+ gives 3x as much, that is still terrible for doing actual work.",

When that happens it is useful to switch to other models like `Gemini 2.5 Pro` or `o3`.\n\nAlso with `Augment Code` you can't even pick your model, and it is either always `Claude Sonnet 4` or they are auto selecting for you.\n\nAlso note I said `at the moment` above. It wasn't that long ago that `Gemini 2.5 Pro` was the best model. With `Augment Code` you would then not have the best model. That could happen again at any time.

    "selftext": "2025 is the click-once age: one crisp prompt and code pops out ready to ship. AI nails the labour, but it still needs your eye for spacing, rhythm, and that “does this feel right?” gut check\n\nthat’s where **vibe design** lives: you supply the taste, AI does the heavy lifting. here’s the exact six-step loop I run every day\n\nTL;DR – idea → interface in 6 moves\n\n* Draft the vibe inside Cursor → “Build a billing settings page for a SaaS. Use shadcn/ui components. Keep it friendly and roomy.”\n* Grab a reference (optional) screenshot something you like on Behance/Pinterest → paste into Cursor → “Mirror this style back to me in plain words.”\n* Generate & tweak Cursor spits React/Tailwind using shadcn/ui. tighten padding, swap icons, etc., with one-line follow-ups.\n* Lock the look “Write docs/design-guidelines.md with colours, spacing, variants.” future prompts point back to this file so everything stays consistent.\n* Screenshot → component shortcut drop the same shot into [v0.dev](http://v0.dev) or [21st.dev](http://21st.dev) → “extract just the hero as <MarketingHero>” → copy/paste into your repo.\n\nPolish & ship quick pass for tab order and alt text; commit, push, coffee still hot.\n\nWhy bother?\n\n* Faster than mock-ups. idea → deploy in under an hour\n* Zero hand-offs. no “design vs dev” ping-pong\n* Reusable style guide. one markdown doc keeps future prompts on brand\n* Taste still matters. AI is great at labour, not judgement — you’re the art director\n\nPrompt tricks that keep you flying\n\n* Style chips – feed the model pills like neo-brutalist or glassmorphism instead of long adjectives\n* Rewrite buttons – one-tap “make it playful”, “tone it down”, etc.\n* Sliders over units – expose radius/spacing sliders so you’re not memorising Tailwind numbers\n\nLibraries that play nice with prompts\n\n* shadcn/ui – slot-based React components\n* Radix UI – baked-in accessibility\n* Panda CSS – design-token generator\n* class-variance-authority – type-safe component variants\n* Lucide-react – icon set the model actually recognizes\n\nI’m also writing a weekly newsletter on AI-powered development — check it out here → [vibecodelab.co](http://vibecodelab.co)\n\nThinking of putting together a deeper guide on “designing interfaces with vibe design prompts” worth it? let me know!",

    "selftext": "Hello friends,\n\nI know that most people who use Claude Code and Cloud Sonnet 4 from Cursor typically integrate them into an IDE like VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar tools. Personally, I use both Claude Code and Cloud Sonnet 4 from Cursor for my development work. I’m subscribed to the $20 Claude Code plan and also the $20 plan of Cursor, Claude code generally allows me to work for about 2-3 hours. After that, I have to wait for the usage quota to reset.\n\nDuring that cooldown period, I continue working with Cloud Sonnet 4 from Cursor. However, a challenge I often face is that I have to explain my progress and what I’ve already implemented using Claude code to the Sonnet 4 from Cursor. Sometimes Sonnet picks up from where Claude left off, but other times it doesn’t have enough context — which means I end up spending extra time re-explaining everything.\n\nI’m looking for a smarter solution where both Claude Code and Cloud Sonnet 4 from Cursor can remain in sync and share a common context or memory seamlessly.\n\nOne workaround I’ve considered is maintaining a changelog file where I log all code changes and progress updates. This file could then be shared with the other model when switching.\n\nHowever, I’m curious to know if there’s any better or more intelligent approach — perhaps some built-in feature or external tool — that can help automatically sync context between models without requiring manual effort.",

So… are public phone numbers indexed in Claude somehow?\n\nIn Norway, this isn’t a huge security issue since public numbers are fairly harmless. But in countries where phone numbers are more tightly linked to identity or vulnerable to SIM-swapping, this could be a serious concern.",

    "selftext": "Ever had to debug a system made of 5+ repos, 2 bundlers, and no clear documentation?  \n  \nThat was me yesterday. Here's how I finally untangled it — with the help of AI.  \n  \nThe real value of a tool like Cursor isn’t in clicking buttons to delete a div or generating a dashboard from scratch. It shines when you're trying to understand and refactor complex systems.  \n  \nYesterday, I ran into a bundling issue in one of our microfrontend projects. We typically bundle all fragments with Webpack using serverless-webpack, since our orchestration engine expects consistent output to test fragments locally. But a new fragment had been built with Vite.   \nAnd as expected, trying to integrate it broke the bundle, due to incompatible output formats and issues with our shared libraries.  \n  \nMy first instinct (the anti-AI me + 6 hours of work XD) :  \nGo full manual.  \n  \nI jumped across repos, read configs, compared plugins, debugged exports... and still couldn’t make sense of the full picture.  \n  \nThe next day :   \nI loaded everything into Cursor and gave it maximum context:   \nthe shared library repo, the Vite fragment, the Webpack fragment, and our internal tooling setup.And no — it didn’t magically solve everything. It needed context, especially in a multi-repo system. But the result?   \n  \nWhat Cursor did well:  \n  \n\\- It mapped the architecture with Mermaid diagrams (which honestly made more sense than hours of jumping between files).  \n\\- Compared config differences between Vite and Webpack projects. Suggested a new Webpack config that worked after just a few iterations.  \n\\- Produced a working migration plan — not perfect, but \\~75% of the syntax was spot on. It still required a solid understanding of bundling and project constraints, but it made the path much clearer.  \n  \nCons (real talk):  \n\\- It sometimes added code I didn’t ask for, so I had to review every line carefully.  \n\\- It missed edge cases like:   \n\\- Forgetting to minify the bundle.   \n\\- Not recognizing our \\*.css.ts files as dynamic styles injected via our CSS-in-TS library.  \n  \nIn 2025, it’s no longer about “AI replaces devs” — it’s about how good Developers use AI as a partner. - Know your fundamentals. - Read the code it generates. - Question everything. - And learn how to guide it with the right context. This was one of those moments where AI didn’t just help — it leveled up my thinking.",

    "selftext": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm reaching out here because I'm getting increasingly frustrated with a recurring issue with my Cursor Pro subscription. I've paid for the service, and my account shows the subscription is active until July 2nd, but the app consistently shows me as a free user, and I can't access any Pro features.\n\nI've been in contact with their support team (Sam from Cursor) for over a week now. I've tried their troubleshooting steps (sign out/in, restart app), provided screenshots, and even shared my Cursor version details. They've acknowledged the issue and said they've escalated it to a teammate, but there's been no resolution.\n\nIt's been almost six days, and I'm still stuck on the free version. This is really impacting my work as I'm on a deadline and relying on the Pro features. I've requested urgent updates and even compensation for the lost time, but I'm just getting radio silence after the initial escalation.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this kind of delay or issue with Cursor subscriptions not activating? Any advice on how to get this resolved quickly? This is becoming unacceptable.\n\nThanks for any help or insights!",

Sometimes it’s time based, sometimes it’s just within a few prompts before I switched back to paying per prompt. It wasn’t limiting me so that I would pay for credit. I know this because my credit limit on Cursor was set high and they would allow me a lot of free prompts within the ‘unlimited prompts’ before making me pay for an hour or 2. \n\nI think cursor has started to budget their spending with these third parties (Anthropic etc) and are offering a priority based service with higher plans (ultra). \n\nOn pro this morning I sore every 45 minutes I was pushed to paying for prompts. Lunchtime today I switched to ultra and was using Sonnet 4 max and Opus on Max and sore no rate limiting or additional costs. \n\nTime will tell. \n\nI’m happy to pay - the time and money it saves me, it more than makes up for it.

    "title": "There's a way to infer the model rate limits by checking the cursor's usage tab!",
    "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nThere's been a controversy around the new \"unlimited\" pricing model which doesn't seem to be very transparent with the clientbase. During the past days I've been making some tests to try to infer what could be the rate limit and for me it was a consistent 100 events (sometimes 120, sometimes 80) for Opus 4 Thinking model, before it asks me to upgrade. The \"cooldown\" is several hours, pretty similar to [claude.ai](http://claude.ai) actually.\n\nWhat's interesting is that ever since they \"soft-launched\" that awful Pro Plus plan, this limit for Opus 4 Thinking changed from an average of 100, to just 30. So when they announced \"x3\" more with \"Pro Plus\", it's essentially what we already had but with an increase in pricing, which for me was a consistently 80 up to 130 events.\n\nSo the Ultra Plan with x20 goes inline with what is advertised by Claude Code and Gemini CLI, which averages 1000 events per day in the case of Gemini, and every 5 hours in the case of Claude. This means Cursor is, on average, charging $40 more for their new \"Pro Plus\" plan which is what Claude Code on their \"basic tier\" plan charges for $20, but with the UI/UX and specific rag agentic capabilities that CC lacks, of course. (As far as I know CC has a different context approach that works better for large codebases)\n\nSo there you go...\n\nMy take is that I felt the change in pricing model was fair... Opus is extremely expensive and a the average 100 event limit felt fair and inline with what the others are offering (remember even Claude itself has hard limits on Opus as well). Their Ultra Plan isn't far off from what Google offers for Veo3 access and Claude Code Max.  \nBut this new \"Pro Plus\" is just really disappointing...",

My guess based on my own experience would be the rate limits are token based, not request based. An opus call that writes 1000 lines of code is FAR more expensive than me asking opus what a function does. So you trying to compare events is comparing apples to oranges based on the complexity of the tasks and the amount of input and output tokens used.",

    "selftext": "Hi guys,   \nMight be relevant to some people here  \n  \nThe research team at **Koi Security** has disclosed a critical vulnerability in [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/), the extension marketplace powering VSCode forks like Cursor, Windsurf, Gitpod, VSCodium, and more, collectively used by over **8 million developers**.\n\nThe vulnerability gave attackers the ability to take full control of the entire marketplace, allowing them to silently push malicious updates to *every* extension. Any developer with an extension installed could be compromised, **no interaction required**.\n\nThe flaw stemmed from a misconfigured GitHub Actions workflow\n\nThe issue was responsibly reported by Koi Security and has since been fixed, though the patching process took considerable time.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* One CI misconfiguration exposed full marketplace control\n* A malicious update could backdoor thousands of developer environments\n* Affected platforms include Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, Gitpod, StackBlitz, and more\n* Highlights the growing **supply chain risk** of extension ecosystems\n\nThis isn’t just about one marketplace, it’s a broader warning about the **privileged, auto-updating nature of software extensions**. These extensions often come from third-party developers, run with deep access, and are rarely governed like traditional dependencies.\n\nFull write-up: [https://blog.koi.security/marketplace-takeover-how-we-couldve-taken-over-every-developer-using-a-vscode-fork-f0f8cf104d44](https://blog.koi.security/marketplace-takeover-how-we-couldve-taken-over-every-developer-using-a-vscode-fork-f0f8cf104d44)",

So while you think it might know more it actually doesn’t and because the models are predictive it is almost always better to be surgical.\n\nAdditionally the longer chats bog down your disk writes over time so sometimes it’s good to restart cursor even but you really should be using new chats like every 30 minutes at max.\n\nSometimes even within the same problem, cursor gets the context it needs now anyways.",

Now, as I opt out from the latest unlimited price mode, I saw something interesting and want to have clarification from Cursor.\n\n1. Will the MAX request charge the premium requests at first? For some reasons, when the new pricing first came out, it charged on my premium requests at first.\n2. Is it still possible to up the limit, e.g., change to 3x Pro? I currently do not see such an option other than changing from monthly to yearly.\n3. For the premium requests, is the context window the same as non-MAX mode, or it is larger?\n4. If I were to burn my wallet to ashes, the Ultra tier, will it include MAX mode requests for free? If I toggle on the MAX mode, will that still charge my card based on usage or it will just go under the $200 bucket.\n\nThank you all very much in advance!",

But it just seems to perfectly coincide with this new update that I installed about an hour ago.\n\n>P.S. I love Cursor, and I’ve been surprised by all the negative feedback about the new Pro plan. I thought the offer was very generous and I overlooked the lack of transparency because it seemed such a great deal. But now it’s clear why they did that: they’re cutting back limits to push users onto the new plan. Obvious in hindsight, but I genuinely didn’t think Cursor would resort to tactics like this.(Assuming my assumptions are correct.)\n\n(Update)\n\nCounter theory.  \nPrior to today, it seemed. All the Anthropic models' rate limits were per model.\n\nAs of today, it now appears that Anthropic models are all using a pooled rate limit. Which may actually be the explanation of what has changed today.\n\nThe fact that I used Opus this morning may have wrecked my rate limit on all the other Anthropic models.\n\nI haven't seen any information about this change to the Anthropic models' rate limits. Regardless of which theory is correct, the lack of transparency leads people to guess and make assumptions for themselves.",

Big red flag right there.\n\nThen there was the actual use of it. Lack of transparency? Check. Weird model handcuffs and tiny token windows? Yep. Every release felt like a bug-hunting expedition where we, the users, were unpaid interns finding all the glitches, upright deliberate misuse of customs.\n\nHonestly, that was enough. We jumped ship to Claude Code ASAP and pretty much stopped using Cursor entirely two months back. Sure, the background agents were kinda neat, but you can kludge something similar together ourselves and have actual control. Plus, even our cloud vendor is rolled out similar AI dev features now.\n\nRight now, stickin' with VS Code and Claude Max is way better, worth the $200. Hope Anthropic keeps Claude Code fully integrated in Claude and maybe even gives us some API use .\n\nAnyway, just our two cents. Later, Cursor. 👋 If you had been building lasting, loyal relationships with the users, you might have lasted.",

I especially liked being able to collapse/expand output of processes that it runs. I wish Cursor had that. The app gets stuck or hangs regularly, but well, it's \"bearable\".  I was able to get stuff done with it.   \nThe pricing is on the expensive side. To give you an impression: after a weekend of (fairly intense) vibe-coding on one project, I ran out of my \"Turbo\" ($40/m) quota on sunday night. \n\nThe total show-stopper for me was that Warp \\*\\*stopped working\\*\\* entirely when I reached the quota, with no option to use slower or cheaper models, or to pay for extra requests. I upgraded to the more expensive subscription and then quickly ran out of quota again. \n\nI was in the middle of a project so I was forced to find alternative tools. That's how I ended up with Cursor. A few hours later I cancelled Warp. \n\nIf you don't use your monthly requests, the unused requests just vanish, even though you've paid for them.  \nOverall I found that everything was too sneaky and deceiving just to get money out of me.\n\nFor example, they offer a \"free\" plan where you get some \"free\" requests. After I bought a subscription I saw they've subtracted the \"free\" requests from my monthly quota. \n\nI see that they now offer \"pay-as-you-go\" once you've reach your quota. So at least they don't block the app for the rest of the month anymore. Out of curiosity I've just tried searching how much that costs, but I can't find that anywhere on their site. After my experiences with them, I'd consider that a major red flag.",

    "selftext": "I think the code quality across AI models be it Claude, Gemini or OpenAI has gone down.\n\nSonnet 4 is good at zero, one-shotting stuff, but the code it outputs is too verbose, sometimes too disconnected. It also completes 1 half of the work, and calls it a day. Forgets binding/integration, even refactoring even when the task highlighted refactoring to be a big deal.\n\no3 is simply not my taste. While the code it produces is highly readable. It would take too many shortcuts, even where ideally any intelligent model would go the other way.\n\nIn personality, sonnet 4 and o3 are opposite in personality\n\nGemini 2.5 pro has been my favourite, but it is not as intelligent as the two other models so while it has good balance, you would need to spend some time with it to actually get a working solution on a complex task.\n\nSonnet 3.7 was just amazing at code quality, just not as intelligent as Sonnet 4.\n\nWhat are your experiences?\n\nEdit: A lot of people think this is a criticism on Cursor, it's not! It's a criticism on the new models.",

This includes representations that could mislead consumers about the nature or characteristics of a service, such as the extent of its usage limits.\n\nCursor's Pro plan is advertised as offering \"unlimited agent requests,\" but it is subject to rate limits based on compute usage. These rate limits are not explicitly detailed on their pricing page, and users have expressed confusion and frustration over the lack of transparency regarding these limitations.\n\nUnder the ACL, failing to disclose material limitations, such as rate limits that affect the usability of an \"unlimited\" plan, may be considered misleading or deceptive conduct. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has previously taken action against companies for similar practices, emphasising the importance of clear and prominent disclosure of any significant limitations on advertised services.\n\nTherefore, if Cursor's rate limits significantly impact the user experience and are not clearly disclosed, their use of the term \"unlimited\" could potentially be in breach of Australian Consumer Law.",

        "body": "Cursors is a useage based system where the larger your requests are, the more it ends up costing cursor.  Some of their requests use internal cursor hosted models and some of them use external models which cost cursor money to use.\n\nI’m just saying this do you have a general idea of how it works. But the cost to make the one single request you made here is enormous compared to something more surgical.\n\nWhat CSS is messed up? The models have to figure that out because you’re not telling them.  This causes some back and forth between cursors internal and external agents. Just finding the file.\n\nHow is it messed up?  What is happening to make it messed up is there a specific error or something looks a certain way.  Cursor isn’t a mind reader now they have to find out what potentially could be the issue out of all the css they have.  This is a massive token sink.\n\nSo while you’re sitting there thinking ‘oh I got 5 requests only before I got rate limited’, your requests aren’t great and could be vastly improved to help reduce the tokens and time it takes for a response.\n\nThink about it like a handyman which is an agentic workflow.  Some jobs are easier and cost less than others but if you have your handyman come by and you say ‘house broken, fix now’ your guy isn’t gonna know what to do he’s gonna have to plunge the toilets, tighten the hinges in the doors, wash the windows, and fix the garage door opener.  And your ‘bill’ is gonna be rightfully higher.  You need to tell him ‘Come in, tighten the screws in the pink guest bedrooms doorframe’.  Bing bang boom he’s in and out in 5 minutes and you’re good to go.\n\nIt’s hard because cursor doesn’t know if a request will be 250 tokens or 25,000 tokens but you can do your part and get more out of it if you’re surgical with your useage.

If you mix context your drift will be REALLY bad and it WILL produce bugs. Also if you start a new conversation it doesn't have the memory of what it messed up the first time.\n\nFew tips:\n\n1. You need to treat it like a very smart intern and do a LOT of handholding. LLMs thrive with structure. Ideally have it work on one file/package at a time.\n2. Don't accept things without reviewing.\n3. Also explicitly tell Cursor to not modify code without consent to support (2) - this should be a settings flag somewhere.\n\n  \nEdit: I'm adding an example for a fullstack react app with 4 pages.\n\n1. Context 1: Build the parent page and the tabs\n\n2. Context 2: Build page 1 and iterate - explicitly tell it to peruse the parent page and fit the page into the overall UX and code design. Put on your sr dev hat and do a critical code review.\n\n3. Context 3: Build page 2 and specifically tell Cursor to infer design and code structure from page 1\n\n4. Context 4, 5: Repeat for pages 3 and 4\n\n  \nYou also have to keep reviewing if Cursor is understanding the existing design and correct manually. Like I said, HANDHOLDING.",

It’s super easy and gives you some permanence. If you muck it up just make sure you have git or restore a checkpoint.  \n\nYou don’t need a map anymore just vibe away and try things out there are no wrong decisions (unless it comes to your project architecture haha, but that should all be planned way before hand anyways).",

There are two types of limits: burst rate limits and local rate limits. Burst rate limits can be dipped into at any time for particularly bursty sessions but are slow to refill. Local rate limits refill fully every few hours.\n\nRate limits are based on the total compute you use during a session.

It's just not clear what you're actually getting and when you're limited, so I'm not sure how you can say it's cheap for what it offers, when we don't really know what it offers.\n\nEdit: Apparently there's a page for rate limiting now that says it resets every few hours but there is also a \"burst limit\". Does anyone know how to see the current \"burst limit\" amount you have left? \n\n\"By default all individual plans are subject to rate limits on Agent. There are two types of limits: burst rate limits and local rate limits. Burst rate limits can be dipped into at any time for particularly bursty sessions but are slow to refill. Local rate limits refill fully every few hours.\n\nRate limits are based on the total compute you use during a session. This can vary based on the model you select, the length of your messages, including the length of files you attach and length of current conversation.\"",

They constantly move the field posts as to what which tier gets you, how much of it it gets you, and your access to models being arbitrarily made more expensive to justify the price they charge.

It’s what makes us accurate, and iterative. I think if agents could do this, the quality of their output would jump massively.\n\nWould love to hear what the dev team thinks about this.

That's precisely how I work with agents, if it's a user-facing feature, then start with an E2E test, TDD-style (or adjust the test/write a regression in case of bugs). This signficantly increases the autonomy of the agent.\n\nIf it's not user-facing, it might be better to instruct the agent to write a unit or integration test. User-facing or not, you always do it from the perspective of a consumer - the actor in this case could be another part of your app/system.\n\nFor simpler apps, I think focusig on E2Es is fine, but the it can clog the build quickly because E2Es tend to be slower.\n\nI tend to follow this [https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-testing-trophy-and-testing-classifications) for tests, and base my TDD rules around it. I don't like to overdo on unit tests either. I think E2Es are great but integration tests hit the sweet spot :)\n\nAnyway, I digress. Any kind of TDD flow will help with the autonomous feedback loop for agents. E2Es with playwright are the best for user-facing full-stack features, start from there and you can then add more fine-grained tests (or not).",

        "body": "You're totally right about the value of active testing and validation, that iterative feedback loop is key for quality code. But I think you might be underestimating just how complex the testing landscape actually is.\n\nPlaywright is great for browser-based testing, but the reality is there are literally thousands of different testing frameworks and tools that developers use depending on their stack, environment, and requirements. Desktop apps, mobile apps, APIs, embedded systems, databases, hardware interfaces, etc. Each domain has its own specialized testing approaches. Playwright can't test everything, and assuming it could handle all validation scenarios would be a pretty narrow view of software development.\n\nThe good news is that what you're describing is already possible today if you set it up properly. I have Cursor configured to automatically run my Playwright tests after it generates code.  I designed those tests, Cursor helped write them, but I validated them. The key insight here is that Cursor isn't meant to magically figure out how to test your software, you need to tell it how to test your software.\n\nHere's the bigger issue though: asking AI to generate meaningful tests is often counterproductive. AI will frequently just \"make it work\" by generating tests that essentially return true regardless of the actual functionality. If the AI were truly capable of knowing whether your software was functioning correctly without your input, there would be no need for you to be involved in the engineering process at all.\n\nYou've actually hit on the key aspect of human involvement in AI-assisted coding right now. You're responsible for testing the software. You can make your life easier by defining automated tests, and AI can help with a lot of the rote framework setup for that automated testing, but you still need to implement the actual test cases yourself. That's where the real engineering judgment comes in.\n\nHaving comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests should already be part of your development process. Once you have that foundation, getting Cursor to leverage those tests is straightforward. But expecting the AI to understand and implement testing strategies for arbitrary software on the fly without that groundwork is probably asking too much, at least with current technology.",
