It took a decent amount of time to make these strictly with AI, probably a total of 40 hours at the computer. In the end, I used about 3700 credits. I would give Claude4 a 6 out of 10 on debugging. It would eventually get there, but this is where I burnt most of the credits. It would fix one thing just to break something else. Sometimes it would also remove some functions of the site and would have to re-add later. Using the planning feature helps with this a lot, for both the AI and you to reference back to.",

    "title": "Structured Workflow - Force AI to Work in Phases",
    "selftext": "Hey y'all,\n\nSo I've built an MCP server that fits into my workflow and thinking process while I'm programming. I made it available via npx and you can download it yourself if you want something local. In essence I was doing some repeated tasks with AI where I wanted it to complete refactoring work for part of a larger project. I was struggling because it was often missing or glossing over key things: classes or systems that already exist (a preferences service for example), creating duplicates of things or when correcting mistakes, leaving orphaned unused methods/code around places.\n\nI sort of stumbled on this idea of the model needing to perform an audit and inventory of the current project (or not even the whole project--just one layer or feature in a project) before moving to any kind of implementation phase. I tried this with rules with limited success and then prompting with much better succcess but I was constantly repeating myself. So I started noodling on this idea of an MCP server that forced the AI to work through a problem in phases or lanes. So that's what this does. There's a number of different workflow styles and I'm open to any other ideas or improvements. Feel free to check it out here if it helps your use case:\n\n[https://github.com/kingdomseed/structured-workflow-mcp](https://github.com/kingdomseed/structured-workflow-mcp)\n\nYou can install via npx and a couple other ways. It's a work in progress but it has been doing a pretty great job for what I'm using it for now. Happy to share more if you are interested.",

What you’ve got looks like an older Euro Pin (a.k.a. \"Euro-Pin\" or \"European Pin\") system with a rubber hourglass tendon.\n\nHere’s what you need to know and do:\n\n\n---\n\n✅ Identification\n\nThe hourglass rubber part is a tendon joint, very common across brands like Chinook, Streamlined, Neil Pryde, etc.\n\nThe pin connector is a Euro-Pin style (used in 80% of modern gear, vs. US Cup).\n\nThe logo on the rubber looks like Neil Pryde or a clone, but most tendons are cross-compatible.\n\n\n\n---\n\n❌ Can It Be Fixed?\n\nIf the rubber tendon is cracked, torn, or separated:\nDo NOT sail on it. It’s unsafe. You’ll lose your rig and possibly damage other gear or yourself.\n\nIf the plastic or metal hardware is cracked or broken, also a no-go. Best bet is replacement.\n\n\n---\n\n💸 Replacement Options\n\nYou’ve got two options:\n\n1. Full replacement mast base – new complete Euro-Pin mast base from:\n\nChinook, Streamlined, Neil Pryde, Unifiber, etc.\n\nCost: $70–$120 USD depending on brand and tendon vs mechanical vs rubber hourglass.\n\n\n\n2. Replace just the tendon – if the hardware is reusable (looks sketchy here though):\n\nRequires tools: hex keys, vice grips, marine-grade threadlock\n\nTendon cost: $15–$25 USD\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n🛒 Where to Buy (Fast)\n\nwindsurfing-direct.com\n\nIsthmus Sailboards\n\nThe House\n\nChinook USA\n\nAmazon/Ebay (less ideal for fitment)\n\n\n\n---\n\n🔧 Pro Tip\n\nIf you’re unsure of fit:\n\nTake the full broken unit into a windsurfing shop, or contact a supplier with these pics and ask for “Euro Pin tendon base replacement.”\n\nIf there’s a serial or part number, use that in search (e.g., 7500.N or 7875 might be internal codes).",

    "title": "Claude 4 - Claude Code vs. Windsurf",
    "selftext": "**Disclaimer**: this is MY OWN experience, and hopefully this is good feedback for the Windsurf team.\n\nSince Claude Code became available to all Pro users, I decided to run Claude 4 Sonnet with it on the Windsurf IDE and use Claude 4 Sonnet from Windsurf with API pricing when I run out of tokens/queries from my Claude Pro account. In this way, they both had access to the exact same Codebase/git, files etc...Moreover, I do have a rules file for Windsurf and I do ask it to plan things ahead using planning mode.\n\n\n\n**- Execution -**\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that Claude Code is really good at understanding the Codebase, classes, imports, and somewhat puts it all together to answer my question correctly around 85-90% of the times. This experience is also the same when I use the bare VS Code (which ultimately is what Windsurf is built on), but while it's logical for that to happen, it was a good sanity check.\n\nNext, when I switched to Claude 4 Sonnet using Windsurf (API pricing), I noticed that it generally needs a couple of tries to fully get what I'm trying to say, even if I use a similar prompt structure across all my requests. I often also found myself seeing code written, and stopping the workflow and saying \"this section of code is incorrect and NOT what I asked, since your code does XYZ it will cause ABC, I instead asked for HKJ\". Then it goes back, takes another couple of tries and finally gets it right. All this made it VERY expensive and I plowed through 500 credits faster than I wanted. \n\n\n\n**- Token Efficiency -**\n\nNow, let's assume that I have the exact same number of tokens available to burn through. And again, this is my experience. \n\nI noticed that the ration between the number of requests I do and correct number of answers I get is much lower in Claude Code than in Windsurf + Claude 4 Sonnet. This results in fewer tokens used for input/output and, being more efficient, you get more bangs for your bucks. I think that's partially because it better understands the structure of the Codebase/git, but I can't confirm for Windsurf.\n\n  \n\n\nOverall, I will probably keep Windsurf as backup but I'm mostly using Claude Code for now...Windsurf team, I hope this helps.",

The models (ChatGPT, SWE and Claude 3.7) keep on hallucinating and returning outdated approaches or simply code that doesn't work at all. Whenever you tell them it's wrong, they come back with yet another approach that doesn't work, in a way that they end up going in circles. It also makes up procedures and Python classes. \n\nOn the other side, Cascade autocompletions, which used to be very good, now just returns garbage. Every time you use Tab, you never know what/how much code is going to change, it changes code that was never meant to change. I can't trust it anymore, I keep on git stashing or committing code all the time because a couple of times I lost hours of work from unsolicited changes. Of course, undo and redo doesn't work well when Cascade is open, making impossible going back to old code without Git.\n\nIt takes much longer than before as it's trying to build \"plans\". \n\nShould I try Cursor? I don't know what to do. I end up giving up and coding myself, disabling Cascade because it keeps on suggesting useless code.\n\nI use Terraform, AWS CDK and Python Lambdas.",

This appears to be a rather low bar)\n\nIn general though, I'd say they can't tell transparency even if I intentionally share the mockup with items behind it. They can't tell not to include a standard title bar when the mockup has none or a custom one, they always fallback to making close buttons turn red - sometimes only on hover - they let the system theme sliders even when I explicitly have say, white circles and a white line. They struggle to interpret small requests like a combobox having a circle or unicode symbol instead of an SVG for the drop down click. \n\nAlignments are another big issue! Even if everything is explicitly aligned in my image, say a series of buttons in a grid, models will typically deliver at least one of them larger than the others or cut-off. Cutt-offs also always happen on slider knobs without fail.\n\nEr, sorry, that was probably too verbose and rambly but they are some examples!",

    "selftext": "I ran a flow action on Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking). It cost 🥁\n\nA bit over 17 flow action credits. Oof!\n\nQuantity of output was similar to Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) - which is 1.25 credits per flow action. Quality was better, not remarkably better but noticable if you paid close attention. \n\nWorth it? No. Two calls to Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) would have resulted in the same output if not more. That's only 2.5 credits. And it would have taken the same amount of time, Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking) is really slow right now.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nMy question for you: if you've tried Claude 4 Sonnet (Thinking) or any others BYOK, how's that cost you?

But after using Cursor Pro since last autumn until recently and then looking at every other option, i think the others caught up:   \n\\- Co-Pilot is very cheap and first month is free. They have Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro and a decent agent mode.  \n\\- Windsurfs o3 is good and on a level with Claude Sonnet 4.  \n\\- Claude Code Max (5x / 100$) in the console of windsurf or VS Code or cursor can interact with the IDE and provide auto completion.  \n  \nThe combination of those 3 - if you can spend 125$ per month - currently does all my work for me.\n\nI surf on the waves of Opus 4 (which makes up 20% of the budget of Claude Code Max 5x that resets every 5 hours), might upgrade to Max 25x because Opus is so extremely good when you use planning mode. You can even drag & drop (saved) images to the claude code console and this way work on UI. It's faster with mcp so it can also surf the website directly. It tends to just use curl and have a look at the markup and css returned, which is even faster than mcp or screenshots. It's just a joy.\n\nWith cursor you will pay yourself to death if you want to use Opus. You could - as far as i know - bring your own key of Claude Max to cursor. But what for? I don't think it will perform better than the original Claude Code CLI.\n\nLast but not least, Cursor has cost me customers and revenue since February, because i was relying only on it and they had weeks where nothing worked right. They don't care about quality.\n\nFree (but who knows what they do with your data..): rovodev from atlassian, gemini cli (very new), roo code + chutes AI deepseek v3 or deepseek v1 0528\n\nRoo Code: use orchestrator mode and dont forget to set the account you wanna use for every mode -> you could use different ai models for different modes",

    "title": "Windsurf quietly changed pricing and gave early users false security",
    "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n1. Windsurf promised $10/month forever for early adopters.\n2. After selling the company for billions, they changed the \"$10/month forever\" promise to \"only for the next year.\"\n3. They began revoking users' early adopter status through policy changes that were not communicated via email. Additionally, they falsely assured users that their status would be maintained.\n\nAny early adaptor that sees this: This is called **bait and switch** and it is a **fraud**. Report Windsurf to Better Business Bureau here: [https://www.bbb.org/](https://www.bbb.org/) and to FTC, here: [https://www.ftc.gov/complaint](https://www.ftc.gov/complaint)\n\n**Detailed post:**\n\nI used to think Windsurf was a solid company, especially with how they treated early users. But their recent pricing change was handled in a shady way. **They quietly removed early bird perks without informing users, while creating a false sense of security through a misleading email.**\n\nI emailed them about this, thinking maybe I missed something and they claim the change was announced via email, but the link they shared **doesn’t mention** that early bird users would lose their perks if they paused and resumed their membership, something that was allowed before. Now, pausing immediately cancels your perk. They replied with a completely different pricing page URL (https://windsurf.com/pricing) that has no connection to the email they sent to users.\n\nHere’s the email they sent:\n\n>*Hi xxx,*\n\n>*Today, we’re announcing some important updates to our pricing structure. In short:*  \n \n\n>***We got rid of the flow action credit system***\\*. Now, each message you send to Cascade just consumes 1 prompt credit, no matter how many steps or tool calls Cascade makes in response.\\* \n\n>***Your Pro plan is the same price as before*** *and still includes 500 prompt credits per month. Add-on prompt credits can be purchased at $10 for 250 credits. Like before, unused add-on credits will roll over month to month.* \n\n>***Any Flex credits you had have been converted 1:1*** *to add-on prompt credits.*\n\n>*We hope that these changes greatly simplify pricing and also help you get more value for each dollar you spend with us. To read more, visit* [*windsurf.com/blog/pricing-v2*](https://edd2q.r.ag.d.sendibm3.com/mk/cl/f/sh/7nVU1aA2nfsTTJnpDUooAxsIijItemm/1KkQb-tNEnri)*.*\n\n>*Best,*\n\n>*Windsurf Team*\n\nSounds harmless, right? The pricing page doesn’t mention this change. Instead, **they hid the policy update on a different page unknown to early bird users**. Plus, the emailed page (https://windsurf.com/blog/pricing-v2) creates **a false sense of security** by stating this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezkokeaxy0af1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=925d62327ca9fdf3761c33a54c83f053b8d22a9c\n\nThey:\n\n1. Inform you that **nothing has changed and you can keep your early bird perk**\n2. At the same time they change totally different pricing change and say that **ah if you pause and continue membership you will lose your perk.**\n\nClearly, this is a move to push out early users, raise prices, and force everyone onto the new pricing tier. I emailed them about this, but they don’t care whether they informed users or not.\n\nIt’s not the price itself that’s the problem, but the shady way they handled it, this says a lot about the company.\n\nCustomers beware: a $5 increase may seem small now, but you could get duped by these tactics in the future.\n\nP.S.: They’re instantly downvoting early bird users who found out that the company canceled the so called \"forever early adopter\" account status. This is a shady company that kicked out early adopters after selling the company for billions, and now they are canceling their status while breaking the promise they made to early users.",

At the time, we did communicate that the pricing would remain available indefinitely.\nHowever, as Windsurf has evolved, the new plans we’ve introduced offer significantly more value and capabilities at a much lower cost than before. To ensure fairness across our growing user base and to sustain the platform’s long-term development, we made the difficult decision to revise the early adopter policy. That said, we’ve ensured that all early adopters retain access to the special pricing for a full additional year from the time of the change — well beyond a typical notice period.\nWe truly appreciate your continued support and hope the improvements we’ve made to the platform reflect our commitment to providing value. If you have specific concerns or would like help choosing the best plan for your needs, I’d be more than happy to assist.",

It handles basic code stuff and simple refactoring without too much hassle. Can't complain about getting it for free right now. But I'm honestly a bit baffled by the \"free for a limited time\" label. I'm not sure I'd pay for it once that runs out. It's fine, but when I compare it to literally any other model, it just doesn't feel like it's worth spending credits on.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something though. Anyone finding it valuable enough that you'd actually pay for it? Or are you in the same boat where it's nice as a freebie but probably not much beyond that?",

    "selftext": "Hello friends,\n\nI know that many people who use **Claude Code** and **Cloud Sonnet 4** from Cursor integrate them into IDEs like VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar tools.\n\nPersonally, I’m subscribed to both:\n\n* **$20 Claude Code plan**\n* **$20 Cursor plan**\n\nHere’s my workflow:\n\n* **Claude Code** generally allows me to work for about **2-3 hours** before I hit my usage quota and have to wait for it to reset.\n* During that cooldown, I switch to **Cloud Sonnet 4 from Cursor** to keep working.\n\n**My challenge:**\n\nWhen switching, I often have to **re-explain my progress and what I’ve implemented**. Sometimes Sonnet 4 can pick up where Claude left off, but other times it doesn’t have enough context, which costs me extra time repeating details.\n\nI’m looking for a smarter solution where **Claude Code and Sonnet 4 can share context or memory seamlessly**.\n\nOne idea I’ve tried is maintaining a **changelog file** where I log all my code changes and progress. I share this file with whichever model I switch to next. But it’s still a manual process.\n\nI’m wondering:\n\n* Is there a better way to keep context synced automatically between these models?\n* Are there any **built-in Cursor features, plugins, or external tools** that help with this problem?\n* How do you handle context switching between different AI tools in your workflow?\n\nAny tips or experiences would be really appreciated!",

Extreme system sluggishness\n2. Unresponsive UI\n3. High CPU usage (238.5% on a single process)\n4. Abnormal virtual memory allocation (over 1TB)\n5. General system instability\n\n# Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Start IDE Application 1.10.5 on Ubuntu 25.04\n2. Open a project with multiple files\n3. Let the application run for approximately 10-15 minutes\n4. Observe resource usage with `top` or system monitor\n\n# Additional Notes\n\n* The issue persists across system reboots\n* The problem appears to be specifically with the renderer process\n* A language server extension might be contributing to the issue, as it is also consuming significant resources\n* The system has adequate hardware resources (64GB RAM, modern CPU and GPU)\n* No swap space is being used, indicating memory is not a bottleneck\n\n# Attempted Workarounds\n\n* Restarting the IDE application provides temporary relief but the issue recurs\n* Killing specific IDE processes temporarily improves system performance\n\nQuestions\n\n1. Whether this is a known issue with version 1.10.5\n2. If any specific extension could be triggering this memory leak\n3. Any configuration changes that might mitigate this issue\n4. If there is a more stable version recommended until this is fixed\n\nAdditional information can be provided to help diagnose and resolve this issue if needed.",

This feature is only available for messages sent with premium models.\n\n# 3. Allow List\n\nYou can create an allow list of terminal commands that will always auto-execute. For example:\n\n* If you add `git` to the allow list, then Cascade will always automatically accept commands like `git add -A`\n* If you add `npm` to the allow list, npm commands will auto-execute\n\n**To configure the allow list:**\n\n* Open Command Palette → Open Settings (UI)\n* Search for `windsurf.cascadeCommandsAllowList`\n* Add the commands you want to auto-accept\n\n# 4. Deny List\n\nConversely, you can create a deny list of commands that will never auto-execute:\n\n* For example, if you add `rm` to the deny list, Cascade will always ask for permission before running `rm` [`index.py`](http://index.py)\n\n**To configure the deny list:**\n\n* Open Command Palette → Open Settings (UI)\n* Search for `windsurf.cascadeCommandsDenyList`\n* Add commands you want to always require manual approval\n\nThe most straightforward approach would be to enable **Turbo Mode** if you want most commands to auto-execute, or carefully configure your **Allow List** with specific commands you trust to run automatically.",

It also ignore taskmaster too.   \nMeanwhile roo and cline follows it closely.   \nI'm wasting alot of credit just to ask it to fix the issues it made and the dependecies hell it brought me, at this point I'm more effective with coding myself + roo/cline assistance. \n\nAm I the only one facing this issue?

The browser and the ability to chat with cascade and also as someone who's still learning how to code, seeing what changes it wants to make and implementing them myself or accepting in the file, it's all so seamless.\n\nBut over the last month, I've grown accustomed to claude code in the terminal. I see there's a BYOK in cascade for claude 4 but I'm guessing there's no way to use it on a max plan right?\n\nI like the fixed fee and also think the plans are a better deal so would prefer that. \n\n  \nClaude is doable but the terminal is just not as good of an experience for me. E.g. I've made my own .md files (todo) for example, but noticed that cascade does the same thing but automatically.\n\n  \nLots of things I hacked together just happen in cascade, it's really well though out so I'd prefer to use that if possible.",

But I have seen some posts from people hitting a rate limit with Claude, but I haven’t hit one at all yet. But I don’t like vibe code all day with it, I ask it for help sometimes but I’m not just vibe coding apps all day, so maybe if you do that you hit the limit, I’m not sure.",

Cursor has more unlimited models for the pro account, and these models are usually faster than those of windsurf.\n2. For the same model, cursor is more stable. In the past few days, I've been calling deepseek v3 or deepseek v3.1 in both IDEs every day, but windsurf would refuse to read the file several times a day. When I switched to another model, it could read again. After restarting windsurf, it could read the file again.\n3. When using the same model, cursor often produces more reliable results. Just now, I had an example where I asked windsurf to use deepseek v3 to write a script to extract data from the new\\_json subdirectory and write it into the database. There were a total of 827 files. After it generated the script and I wrote the data in, I counted and found that there were only 450 rows of data in the table! Can you imagine that? Such a simple script actually lost data!\n\nI deleted that script, opened the directory again in cursor, and called deepseek v3.1 to complete the script, and cursor did a great job.\n\nWindsurf sometimes does better, like using gemini-2.5-pro to generate a prototype for a webpage, but most of the time, cursor is still better with claude-4-sonnet.\n\nSo, my conclusion: if you want to complete your work stably, you should choose cursor.",

    "selftext": "Is your AI pair programmer just a glorified autocomplete?\n\nMany developers use tools like Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Cursor passively, but their true power is unlocked when you move from asking questions to giving directions. The key is mastering \"tool calls\"—the specific commands that turn your AI into an active, collaborative partner.\n\nInstead of manually searching your codebase, you can instruct your AI to do a codebase search for the exact context you need. Instead of breaking your flow to create a new file, you can tell it to create the file for you. You can even delegate research by telling it to search the web for documentation.\n\nThis approach has fundamentally changed how I build software, allowing me to stay in a state of flow and delegate the tedious parts of coding.\n\nIn my full article, I share the 25 essential tool calls every developer should know to make their AI assistant more effective.\n\nRead the full post here: [https://reidkimball.com/journal/essential-tool-calls-for-agentic-coding/](https://reidkimball.com/journal/essential-tool-calls-for-agentic-coding/)\n\nWhat are the most effective tools you've used with your AI assistant?

Two hours and dozens of edits later login no longer works at all in my app. Luckily I can discard all the changes and I'm back where i started. \n\nIt seems like Windsurf has gotten progressively worse over the last few weeks. I've never had issues like this. Some annoying stuff, sure. But not like this. \n\nLots of planning and then unable to implement. Stuck on errors that get resolved and the edits spawn new errors, eventually ending up in a loop of the same errors and fixes. Ignoring global rules. Implementing its own flavor when I explicitly tell it to follow the examples in the documentation I've referenced. Ignoring the MCP server with the tools it needs to do things like query my database. Unable to search git. Maybe they're all one offs but I do this in my free time so I'm really getting nowhere with the little time I have. \n\nClaude 4 was moving things forward, but at prices like that it's prohibitive.\n\nI've been a pro subscriber for a long time.

    "selftext": "Over the last few days, Windsurf (with Gemini 2.5 Pro) has been struggling even more than usual when attempting to read files. I thought I'd ask it to explore solutions to this issue, and instead came across a solution that's even better - finally allowing Windsurf to reliably read and write files >200 lines.   \n  \nAfter testing, I ended up with a simple approach where it reads chunks of a file until it reaches the end, then concatenates that into a single string. Surprisingly, when doing this with the 'view\\_file' tool, I found it reliably reading 400 lines per chunk.  \n  \nBelow is the resulting instructions which I've put in my global\\_rules.md. I'm guessing this will increase your token usage, so be warned. In my case, I just want things done correctly and faster, and this seems to be doing that well. Interested to hear if this works for you or perhaps you've come across a better method.\n\nInsert this into **global\\_rules.md**:\n\n    ## Tool Use\n    Methodology for Reliable Large File I/O\n    1. The Challenge: Tool Limitations with Large Files\n    \n    Standard file access tools can be unreliable for large files.\n    \n    view_file (when used without line ranges) often truncates content, showing only the beginning of the file.\n    codebase_search and view_code_item also provide truncated results to conserve resources.\n    Attempting to read or write large files in a single operation is prone to data loss and incomplete transfers.\n    \n    2. The Solution: Chunked Reading\n    \n    To overcome these limitations, we will always read files in controlled segments, or \"chunks.\"\n    \n    Tool: Use the view_file tool.\n    Chunk Size: A chunk size of 400 lines has been tested and proven to be reliable and efficient.\n    Process:\n    Start by reading the first chunk: view_file(AbsolutePath=\"...\", StartLine=1, EndLine=400).\n    Concatenate the returned content into a single string variable.\n    Continue fetching subsequent chunks by incrementing the line range (StartLine=401, EndLine=801, and so on).\n    Stop when the view_file tool returns an empty response, which signals that you have reached the end of the file.\n    3. The Solution: Verified Writing\n    \n    The write_to_file tool has been proven effective for writing large amounts of data at once, provided the data is correctly prepared.\n    \n    Tool: Use the write_to_file tool.\n    Process:\n    First, use the Chunked Reading method described above to read and aggregate the entire file content into a single, complete string variable.\n    Call write_to_file a single time with the complete string as the CodeContent. This is more reliable than writing in multiple, smaller appends.\n    4. When to Use This Methodology\n    \n    This should be our standard operating procedure for all file manipulations, specifically:\n    \n    When reading any file whose size is unknown or suspected to be large.\n    When needing to create an exact duplicate of a file.\n    When performing any \"read-modify-write\" operation where data integrity is critical.\n    By adhering to this tested methodology, we can ensure all future file operations are accurate and dependable.",

    "selftext": "Edit: This isn’t a ‘hidden fees’ issue—the title may accidentally suggest that. Sorry for any confusion!\n\nHello,\n\nI have found myself in a crisis—small for humanity but big enough for me—caused by you.  \nI live in a rural area, so I have to rely on mobile internet. In my country, mobile data is very expensive and limited.  \nThis month, I was shocked to find out that my data quota was exhausted and additional packages were automatically purchased.\n\nMy father recently passed away, I’m in debt, I lost my job, and on top of all that, seeing my extremely high internet bill (70 euros) devastated me beyond words.\n\nNow, what does this have to do with you? When I tracked my internet activity, I noticed that Codeum was constantly sending packets. Even when Sublime was closed, these packets were still being transmitted. I will investigate this further, but you should have somehow informed your users about this issue.\n\nI am incredibly upset, and I want you to know that once I recover from this, I will seriously share this experience.\n\nBuilding and distributing an application like crazy might make you successful, but true success, in my opinion, lies in keeping that success under control. I hope you develop better software, and I hope your success gives you time to think about struggling developers as well.\n\nGood day.\n\n**Trace your mac for codeum:**  \nps aux | grep language\\_server\n\n[server.codeium.com](http://server.codeium.com) \\--manager\\_dir /var/folders/py/9dhyplw14\\_xd\\_w70g7js5qnh0000gn/T/tmp138koxm8 --run\\_child --random\\_port --random\\_port\\_dir=/var/folders/py/9dhyplw14\\_xd\\_w70g7js5qnh0000gn/T/tmp138koxm8/child\\_random\\_port\\_1733237769589949000\\_5834946513961761102 --manager\\_lock\\_file=/var/folders/py/9dhyplw14\\_xd\\_w70g7js5qnh0000gn/T/tmp138koxm8/locks/manager.lock --child\\_lock\\_file /var/folders/py/9dhyplw14\\_xd\\_w70g7js5qnh0000gn/T/tmp138koxm8/locks/child\\_lock\\_1733237769590071000\\_8324603389294913721\n\n/Users/hidedusername/.codeium/sublime/language\\_server\\_macos\\_arm.download --api\\_server\\_url [https://server.codeium.com](https://server.codeium.com) \\--manager\\_dir /var/folders/py/9dhyplw14\\_xd\\_w70g7js5qnh0000gn/T/tmp138koxm8  \n/Users/hidedusername/.codeium/sublime/language\\_server\\_macos\\_arm.download\n\nsudo pkill -f codeium\n\nls \\~/Library/LaunchAgents\n\nls \\~/Library/Application\\\\ Support/Codeium\n\nrm -rf \\~/.codeium\n\nnettop",

    "selftext": "I have been using Windsurf since December. I suppose that makes me an old user, and that is kinda funny. The velocity in this space is nuts.\n\nWindsurf has changed my life, I have *very* few complaints. However, the biggest hurdle in my experience has been knowing when to start a new chat. There is [a great peer reviewed study](https://github.com/adobe-research/NoLiMa) showing that even models that advertise 100k+ token context windows, drop from >90% accuracy at 1k tokens, to ~50% accuracy at 32k tokens. We all live this as users. \"Just start a new chat\" is a common explanation as to why things are not working ideally.\n\nA couple months ago, on the Discord [0] someone who I believe is on the Windsurf team said \"you should start a new chat every 4 or 6 prompts\"\n\nIs that still the case? Can we all have a quick discussion about how to fix this UX? I have posted a feature request about a context health bar, but maybe that's not the best idea. What's an ai-first way for Windsurf to deal with that? Maybe ai-first is not the ideal solution? Maybe just giving the user a tiny bit of credit, and giving something like a health bar would be better than nothing?\n\nIs the new direction to just have one big long chat? If not, shouldn't there be some indication of when to end it?\n___\n___\n___\n___\n\n[0] tangent: Hiding knowledge in a non-crawlable Discord server will lead to knowledge being locked away from Google and LLM crawlers. Why in the heck would anyone running a product want that? You want as many models as possible to train on \"how do I do _ in Windsurf\". Why would you not put that on Reddit? Supabase is the king of having real dev team members reply to randos like me on Reddit, Windsurf feels way behind in that regard.",

    "selftext": "Not sure how possible this is but I think a killer feature for Windsurf would be the ability to chat with the agent from my phone and review the changes it’s making. \n\nThis would really free me up to get on with my life while still being productive at work. Particularly as the agentic AI gets better I’m able to give it larger tasks which take longer to complete. It would be so good to be able to get away from my desk while it’s running while still being able to check in and keep it moving in the right direction remotely. \n\nThis sort of interaction is already possible with copilot as it runs remotely and leverages the existing GitHub PR interfaces. I’m not a big fan of copilot though and would rather use Windsurf and be able to quickly jump back into the chat session on my laptop once I’m back at my desk.\n\nHonestly I’m surprised I have not seen more people asking for this!\n\nFor me the extension of this is to get a voice interface I can use from CarPlay in my car. 😆\nI absolutely love the idea of being able to ask an agent to add a feature WHILE I DRIVE!!! I know that’s a bit of a stretch before that would be good enough to be anything more than a gimmick but I don’t think it’s that far off.  \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I wanted to answer one question with brutal honesty:\n\n>\n\nNo detailed prompts.  \nNo step-by-step scaffolding.  \nNo cleanup.  \nJust Windsurf, global reasoning protocols, and real-time correction.\n\n# 🧩 The Setup\n\nAs a full-stack Magento engineer, I’ve worked with code generation before. But this time I went hands-off:\n\nI used **Windsurf** with the following stack:\n\n* **Global Rules**: Execution-first logic, architecture validation, self-monitoring\n* **MCPs**: Context7, Atom of Thought, Sequential Thinking, Reflection\n* **Role**: I became the project manager. The AI? The developer.\n\n# ⚙️ Prompting Strategy\n\nAll prompts were **natural, vague, and nonlinear** like what you’d hear in a chaotic product meeting:\n\n* “Create required pages.”\n* “This looks off fix it.”\n* “What else do we need?”\n* “This kind of site needs a way to take in tasks.”\n* “Try again, but make it leaner.”\n\nThis was **not** prompt injection or scaffolding.  \nThis was **contextual reinforcement through reasoning architecture.**\n\n# 🎯 The Goal\n\nBuild a **real-world micro-service** that can intake service tasks (like a Fiverr client request).  \nConstraints:\n\n* 💸 No paid tools\n* 🧱 No bloated frameworks\n* 🪶 Must be lightweight\n* 💻 Must deploy\n* 👀 Must look “good enough”\n\n# 💡 The Result: [https://eheca.net](https://eheca.net)\n\n* ✅ 100% AI-built (zero manual code)\n* ✅ Modular, secure, and functional\n* ✅ Live within 2–3 days (6 hours total dev time)\n* ✅ Deployed untouched\n* ✅ GitHub: linked in comments\n\n# 🧠 Key Architectural Stack\n\n* **Backend:** PHP 8.1 + Slim 4\n* **Templating:** Plates\n* **Database:** SQLite\n* **Styling:** LESS\n* **Security:** CSRF, CORS, Monolog, Dotenv, rate limiting\n* **AI Infra:** Windsurf + Global Rules + MCPs\n\n# 🔬 Takeaways for the Windsurf Community\n\n* Eheca is a **real-world Windsurf benchmark**\n* It proves **autonomous sequencing and architectural continuity** are possible\n* Context7 and Atom of Thought allowed deeper “reason loops” that adapted on vague feedback\n* The Global Rules engine corrected hallucinations and enforced scope constraints\n\n# 🤖 Why Eheca Matters\n\nThis wasn’t “AI that can code.”  \nThis was **AI that could collaborate**.\n\nThe goal wasn’t syntax.  \nThe goal was **design, adjustment, and completion without direct coding help.**\n\nThis shows what Windsurf is capable of when used in the wild.\n\n# 💬 Final Thought\n\nNo filters. No edits.  \nJust a prompt interface and a reasoning core doing its best to **become a dev**.\n\n🔗 **Live demo + GitHub repo in first comment.**  \nIf you’re working on agent autonomy or benchmarking Windsurf under creative constraints take it for a spin.\n\nThis is what it looks like when AI *leads itself*. 🧠✨",

    "selftext": "Cursor just updated their pricing this week. Making all model usages unlimited request for the $20 plan.\n\nI went back to check cursor for Claude 4 (with sonnet in mind), but with the new pricing, users just got given access to Opus 4 at Max context mode. I couldn't believe this and have been trying it this past days with no severe rate limit. Yeah, Opus 4 in Max mode. Anyone comparing the models and that has tried sonnet 4 knows how big of a deal this is.\n\nI fk\\*n hate Cursor UX and their keyboard shortcuts compared to Windsurf. But with the new changes, UX edge of Windsurf can't even come to mind as the capability in coding (the main purpose) over compensates for anything else, with availability of unlimited Sonnet 4, let alone Opus 4 in max mode.\n\nSo, with these changes mentioned about Cursor, what has Windsurf planned us? I am not acting entitled or bitching around. But I love Windsurf, its UX, their innovativeness... and am actually still subscribed, even at $10 from the early days. But the competition and market is as I described. And as a sane product user, I am objectively looking for productivity and capability boost in any such development tool. And with the ongoing huge hurdle of non availability of Claude 4, the Cursor pricing update just happened, making Opus 4 and Max mode available.\n\nSo, this begs the question, what is Windsurf planning to retain its loving users? fixing Claude 4 models (at least sonnet) can be a no brainer starter (not asking for Opus 4, as that won't be feasible, even though the market/competition/cursor has it)\n\nWould really love to see Windsurf consider situations and get into action soon. And put the focus from feature Wave updates to core capability matters like models.",

My grain of salt is that since using the ultra plan I had Opus 4 max thinking included, i've just used it non stop and have seen it downgrade, each time it downgraded it straight up ignored my rules and I've stopped it several times to check the model behind, last reply I got was Opus 3 model.... and it's not a simple AI \"hallucination\" when you've done a whole project with the new Opus and suddenly it becomes dumb as a rock and starts looping you make sure to test it by keeping context and cache always under control. Worst part is usage logs always state its using Opus 4, when it's not, that's how they are giving unlimited calls with the new Claude models when even Anthropic oficial API doesn't give such a good offer or pricing close to that.",

        "body": "Good question. Practicing and patience. You need to understand why you like specific model - but to do that you need to work with it. Initially I started with no rules and pure vibes. Only after a week I introduced .windsurfrules document - all that to gradually see how models behaviours would change. Then introduced specific planning framework - something similar that windsurf just introduced with planning - I have templates that are defined inside the windsurf rules to how I want specific task to be approached and overall guidelines how not only to approach problem but to document it. For example - chat has limited context - and if you are going into pitfall (you don’t know it yet that is a pitfall) you would want AI model to learn from mistakes they made in case you revert them - so you have like a separate document system - in design like RAG - but inside windsurf it’s just system of connected together .md document that provide all the context to model - outside just chat.\n\nJust to give an example - initially started project that I’m working on using Claude models - briefly tried Gemini, but wasn’t satisfied with tool usage it had (it was still during beta) - replies were short and bland. Claude shown more thoughtful thinking. \n\nBut problem with Claude was it was too literal - it would over-engineer solution or make it pass a test using some hardcoded methods - as the goal was to pass the tests. \n\nAt one point switched to Gemini, and with more mature project it shown more thoughtful thinking and good understanding how everything was connected. I really liked how it laid out thinking to you. Claude was quite secretive. \n\nBut - again - Gemini was and still is quite poor with tool usage. It wouldn’t jump to terminal so quickly like Claude would. So even though I was vibe coding I was still glancing through the code changes but more importantly how chat behaves - that’s where I spotted those issues with grep_search. After multiple failure it corrected itself with codebase_search and it worked straight away. Then I noticed by default it will try to use grep_search - so I stopped it there. Since then chat flow much smoother.\n\nComing back to your question - I would also like to see what others learnt through experience - because it seems like it’s no longer only prompt engineering but overall environment engineering with specific guidelines, frameworks - and now - tool usage - something that windsurf could shed some light on - so we can make our own decisions how our system around agents should work.",

If you see agent still getting lost, just remind it to read rules again, and point out to specific section in rules. Good rule of thumb to see if agent is actually following rules is to have “Conversation Protocol” there and make rule to always greet you with specific word - that will give you some certainty that model at least skimmed through the rules. \n\nI believe you can also go as far as excluding this in .gitignore, but haven’t tested it yet - as above solutions are good enough, and don’t want to be to restrictive as that would also block other model like Claude that have better grip with grep_search.",

They have done nothing about it for this long time, and this was not just my opinion but that of many others. People began to speculate that the Cursor team was optimizing models and reducing context in order to pay less, and although officially the team denied it, it was impossible not to notice the difference between the model in Cursor and the original one in solving the same problems.\n\nThere was a bigger crisis with the new Gemini 2.5, where the free model was a paid one in Cursor. There was a wave of negative reviews and posts until mntruell admitted that there was a lack of communication on their part.\n\nPeople, despite requests instead of another plan, lived to see MAX models, and maybe it would have been fine if not for the lack of any transparency in the operation. It is not clear how many times these background tools were called, how they were called, how it worked. Cursor has been unwilling to introduce clear and transparent communication with AI for a long time, they can't even provide a simple update that would show the number of fast tokens, which the community itself had to do. \n\nUsing MAX models is like a lottery, on top of which it may not always fully perform stopping in the middle with an error while taking some cash from your wallet. Such a gamble for developers.\n\n  \nPeople are losing tokens en masse at this point on simple single prompts. Some are disappearing 5-10 tokens each for Claude, which in theory is supposed to cost 0.75 tokens. Some have lost even more. Cursor support explained to users as part of the response that it was probably a complicated question and a long executable operation xD which is not true.\n\nI don't believe in any coincidences because these problems happen all of a sudden when the new Ultra plan is presented.   \n[https://www.cursor.com/pricing](https://www.cursor.com/pricing)  \nCheck out their plan, it used to say at the pro that there are 500 fast tokens and now \"Unlimited agent requests\" (Usage limits apply for some models). If pro is unlimited then why do I need an ultra plan that gives 20x usage on all OpenAI, Claude, Gemini models.  It's not clearly written what the limits are and what models they go on, but I can bet that it's definitely the Claude and Gemini, since those are the most commonly used. Unlimited is probably mainly Grok and some smaller model like Cursor small.",

The cost savings are marginal, if there at all, and I have not observed it to be any more capable than Claude Code running Opus 4.\n\nAdditionally, the Cursor app has always been far rougher around the edges than Windsurf.

In addition, many people have noticed that now instead of a message that you have exceeded the limit it pops up an error “due to high load Claude 4 is now unreachable” or something like that.\n\n  \nThey deliberately introduce less information and further fail to clearly communicate their intentions. The previously simpler plan with clear rules about tokens is now less clear. This isn't the first time they've introduced something important and suddenly people are losing tokens faster or more than they should.\n\nI wrote a bit long, but in short Cursor tries to squeeze as much money out of users as possible and does everything to make users lose as much as possible to make another offer more favorable (the one with more fees). There is a reason why the base models are broken all the time and work worse mainly as MAX was introduced. There's a reason there are so many problems now with the introduction of the Ultra plan. On top of that the opinions of people who experienced such actions are banned by moderators on Cursor's subreddit, I saw that very many posts and comments disappeared today that referred to, among other things, the sudden loss of half of the tokens.

The reason they can afford to offer swe 1 for free is because it's cheap and efficient not because it's incredibly smart.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, more intelligent models can solve more problems but at a longer inference and higher cost. For any one issue, you want to be using the cheapest and fastest model that is capable of solving your problem. \n\n\nFor a ton of issues, swe1 is the cheapest model capable of solving them imo. (not the fastest unfortunately but I'm pretty sure that's more to do with windsurfs availability than the model itself). Yes you can solve these problems with Claude opus too but like you're just burning money to do something a free model can do just as well. \n\n\nThen there are issues that claude can solve that swe1 can't. These scenarios are when it can be worth coughing up cash for Claude. \n\n\nSo they're not even competing really. They're different tools for different use cases and used optimally you'd use both. If swe1 is competing with any Claude model it'd be 3.5 and even that's quite expensive. Definitely not opus lmao. ",

I used to maintain a `ROADMAP.md` document in my repos, or added a similar section to my `README.md` file, where I did the same stuff that Windsurf does automatically with the `plan.md` document. \n\nThe disadvantage to my DIY approach is that I had to explicitly update these planning documents in the chat, so I would, in practice, only do that after a commit, or at the very end of a chat -- if I didn't forget. \n\nWith planning mode, Windsurf keeps the plan up-to-date automatically, which is a huge improvement. I wish the `plan.md` document could be part of the repo files. Right now, Windsurf tucks it away in a hidden directory.",

Im vibe building a react native app and dont get new credits until wednesday, so im stuck with SWE and once it starts failing it bombs bad. ive been fighting with a chat scroll situation for 2 hours because it keeps trying to do things that he cant do. pretty confident guy.\n\nBut yeah, once i knew what was going on i had to surrender and just go with a less flashy solution, but more stable. The only problem is i know there is some bad stuff in there im gonna have to ask claude 4 web to clean up somehow, and then gemini 2.5 to implement it because claude 3.7 is acting drunk all the time in here. #WindsurfLyfe",

They’ve done such a fantastic job with influencers. I think this is probably why they’ve pulled ahead of Windsurf in terms of popularity.\n\nI’ve been using multiple o3 Cascade chats simultaneously and it’s been pretty awesome.\n\nIt would’ve been even better with Sonnet 4 or Gemini 2.5 Pro on full intelligence, though. (I think Gemini 2.5 on Windsurf isn’t at max intelligence tokens, because there’s a night and day difference between Gemini on windsurf and on AIStudio) \n\nHighly recommend.",

Ask me questions until you are 95% sure you can complete the task\n\n2. Use a 3 tier system for tokens\n- tier 1 primitive tokens that define raw values for things like color, font properties, spacing & dimensions \n- tier 2 semantic tokens that provide context for specific uses of the primitives\n- tier 3 components that always and only use semantic tokens. Do not use raw values or primitives with components.\n\n3. Project plan \n- at the start of any new project create a project-plan.md\n-at the start of any new scope review the project plan and update it with any additional context\n-when completing a prompt review work done and update the project-plan accordingly \n\n4. Bug log\n-whenever starting a new project create a bug-log.md\n-whenever you encounter a bug review the bug log\n-once the bug is resolved update the bug log with the issue and the resolution\n\n—\n\nThere is definitely more to add but my previous file was corrupted so I’m starting fresh and seeing how things work with fewer rules.\n\nProject rules are fairly varied depending on the project type. I’ll have cascade write up stuff depending on my tech stack and project scope to keep things aligned to the documentation in the PRD.\n\nMemories I use to store stuff like file paths and common commands that cascade may have called incorrectly.",

That can make it difficult to see the physical layout as there are several things that control it that are not directly specified (eg. flow layout changes).\n\nI have been theorising on some amazing things that you could do if a multi modal model could see your screen. I think that's the goal of Microsoft Copilot running locally on Windows PCs (with hardware NPUs).\n\nI think that the hurdles are:\n1. Privacy. Obviously not a problem in the limited and directed Windsurf/Cascade scenario\n2. Compute. Understanding an image takes a lot more compute (cost) than understanding text\n3. Latency. Per item 2 the response would take longer. Not so much of an issue with Cascade as we are used to waiting for an agentic workflow but could slow it down\n4. Accuracy. Gemini 2.5 Pro is amazing at OCR of screenshots, understanding layout and formatting (including correctly implying tables that have no borders, line-wrapped text, split tables over two pages) with highly accurate text (greater than 99.5%). Most other models I tried were abysmal. They changed the text, many errors with spelling (which is important for a technical analysis of a web page or other screenshot), stopped processing certain parts of the image or had low limits for image size and were basically unusable\n\nObviously this will improve over time but right now the options are a bit limited",

    "title": "Backend setup is still a pain even with AI - building an AI-native BaaS to fix this, thoughts?",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nBeen building side projects with coding agents lately, and while frontend development has gotten ridiculously smooth, backend stuff is still... tedious.\n\n**Example:** Just finished a stock news sentiment analysis app. The AI absolutely crushed the frontend - built beautiful charts, news feeds, filtering systems, everything responsive and polished.\n\nBut then came the backend nightmare. Sure, the AI could help design the SQL schema when I told it exactly what I needed - \"create tables for stocks, news articles, sentiment scores with these specific relationships.\" But every time I wanted to add a feature like user watchlists, I had to walk it through the entire process: \"update the user table, create a watchlist table, add the foreign keys, write the migration script, update the RLS policies...\" Then go over the migration process.\n\nThe edge functions were even worse - news scraping pipeline, LLM sentiment analysis, data aggregation. Sure, the AI could write individual functions, but they kept breaking in production. I'd spend hours digging through logs, debugging why the cron job failed or why sentiment scores weren't updating, then manually deploying fixes.\n\nEventually got everything working, but the whole time I'm thinking - why can't I just tell my coding agent \"add email alerts for watchlists\" and have it handle the schema changes, function updates, and deployment automatically?\n\n**My half-baked idea:** What if there was a BaaS designed so the AI actually understands your backend architecture? Instead of blind CLI calls, the AI has full context of your data relationships, security rules, and business logic.\n\nI'm still figuring out if this idea actually makes sense or if I'm just overthinking my own problems.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n* Do you also find yourself manually fixing things when AI-generated backends break?\n* What's your current workflow when AI hits backend complexity?\n\nWould love to chat with folks who've had similar experiences to see if this resonates or if there are other pain points I'm missing!\n\n",

    "selftext": "**Issue:** Unclear Credit Usage and Missing Support Channels I need to bring attention to a serious UX issue that's affecting multiple users, including myself.\n\n**The Problem**:\n\n* Windsurf silently used up all my credits when my personal API key was exhausted, with ZERO warning or notification\n* The UI provides no clear indication of when it switches from using your API key to consuming Windsurf credits\n* Support channels are nearly impossible to find (no clear email, support form, or in-app contact)\n* This behavior is not documented clearly in the UI or pricing pages\n\n**My Experience**: I set up my personal API key thinking I was covered, only to find all my Windsurf credits gone without warning. This is unacceptable UX design, especially for a paid product.\n\n**What's Needed**:\n\n1. Clear, visible warnings before Windsurf credits are used\n2. An actual support email or contact form that's easy to find\n3. Better documentation about credit usage and API key fallback behavior\n4. A way to disable automatic credit usage when API key is exhausted\n\nI want to like Windsurf, but this kind of dark pattern is making it very difficult. I'm not the only one experiencing this - I've seen similar complaints from other users.\n\n**Request**:\n\n* Can the Windsurf team please address this?\n* Will affected users be refunded for the unexpected credit usage?\n* When can we expect better communication about credit usage in the UI?",

I was in the middle of a very involved refactoring mission..  \n I've calmed down now..!  X D  \n  \nI found the support chat box in the end.. well right at the end of the page.. it's pretty opaque to be honest - I realise you're trying to get people to solve their own problems so you don't get overwhelmed with tickets for simple issues - but when you need support, you need support.)   \n  \nI have got a ticket through but not diagnostics...  \nShould I append them to the support email?\n\nIn reality I really feel the issue here is about opaque pricing and charging mechanisms and a lack of clear user notification in the UX, it's not really much to do with anything at my end imho...  \nThe small letters api do not have a hover info tip or any links or anything to mark them out as a new feature, and unlike the other models, there is no token price per prompt either.  \n  \nIt is not at all clearly evident  to the user what is going on.  \n  \nNor is their any clear, easily accessible information on the subject anywhere I could find, which should of course, be clearly linked and accessible at the point of use, in the UI.   \n  \nIt should be easily accessible, clearly marked as a change -  especially when anything to do with billing.  \n  \n\"Api\" has to be one of the vaguest terms possible in my opinion, not to mention in especially tiny muted lettering.  \n  \nThings are pretty tight at the moment and that NZ$27 a month is not trivial for me ..  \nI usually make those credits last, only using premium models for analysis planning and task setting.\n\nI was working on a hierarchical distributed config system with user prefs and a singleton pattern core config, with module level local configs inheriting from a base config class that uses that singleton - and one wrong move broke everything .. Even the top tier models were struggling to grasp the system-  so yeah.. stressful. (for this relative noob anyway)... Not a good time to be stuck with free models.  \nI got there in the end but hours of work later.\n\nRegards,  \nQuinn",

        "body": "Hard to compare that because they work very differently.   Claude Code is autonomous and works like write mode but with minimal user action.   \n\nYou give it a task, it creates a plan, executes the plan and work till all steps have been completed.   You can then review the work in windsurf.  \n\nThe integration between windsurf and Claude code is minimal.  Given its terminal based you can run it from any terminal.   \n\nThe catch is that you can use up your quota of Claude code really quickly if you only have pro plan and not max (which costs $100/m). Use it for more complex tasks or maybe tasks you really don’t want to do.   Which is where the windsurf sub could become beneficial again. So you can use that while waiting for your quota to reset.   \n\nThough I decided today to try Claude max. I’ll probably cancel windsurf for now since I won’t really need cascade as much. \n\nSome others worth looking into are Google Jules and Atlassian RovoDev.  Both are in a “free beta period” with limited use but limits are pretty high.  \n\nGoogle Jules allows 60 tasks a day. I use it for documentation / test generation usually.  It’s cloud based and works directly off of GitHub.  \n\nRovo Dev allows 20m tokens a day which is actually a lot.    This is terminal based and is nearly identical to Claude code but not as feature rich (no MCP support yet for example) \n\nWorkflow I’m testing right now is refactoring a code base with Claude Code and Rovo working on different refactors.   Jules then makes sure the refactored code integrates with the app and removes legacy code and updates tests / documentation.",

Not only did it handle complex changes across 20 files with just 1 credit (thanks to Cascade), but what really blew me away was **Planning Mode**.\n\nWith some added post-dev audit instructions, it’s on another level. No more missed steps, no more silly errors. It’s smooth and super reliable now.\n\nHonestly, Planning Mode is so solid that I don’t even feel trying Claude Code anymore.\n\nDefinitely worth a revisit if you skipped Windsurf before.",

I just 'trust' it more than other agentic IDEs now, including Windsurf, which is so important as a professional dev. I've only had to correct a blatant mistake from it maybe a handful of times. With Cursor or Windsurf, I'd regularly have to course correct it through each prompt and really scrutinise it to make sure it was on track. I just don't have to do that as much in Claude Code. \n\nThat's not even including Claude Desktop, which has a huge amount of use cases on it's own. I'm working on a side project, and the Project feature + Deep Research is incredibly useful through the planning phase. You can basically store all your product requirements there, and use it as a sort of memory bank, getting it to generate really detailed PRDs, then using the Linear MCP to create a bunch of tasks, and then ask Claude Code to pull each task down one by one and work on them. It's a really effective workflow for me.\n\n  \nIn about a week of having it, I've already used around $150 USD worth of credits (according to the \\`ccusage\\` tool you can find on Github), so it's definitely worth it.",

The best I can gather from that is maybe 45 messages allowed every 5 hours? So I guess how much value you can actually get out of that will depend a lot on what you're doing and how you use it. I spend a lot of time asking whichever model I'm using to explain concepts to me to better understand what it's doing or recommending and I feel like I'd end up eating through that 45 message/5 hour limit pretty often.",

This is causing Amazon Bedrock to reject the request.\n    \n    ## Here's how to fix it:\n    \n    1. In your tools/db.py or wherever you're defining your tools, make sure every tool has a non-empty description field.\n    \n    2. Based on the error trace, you're using LiteLLM to call OpenRouter, which then calls Amazon Bedrock.

    "selftext": "I love all the recent waves and updates to the UX of Windsurf. Even before these, Windsurf has the best UX of all the ai editors such as Cursor.\n\nBut the reality is that, no amount of great UX can replace capability. Even after getting back to it almost a year later, Cursor UX really sucks in comparison, and won't be better as their UX philosophy is really bad. But with Claude 4 sonnet, it gets the job done. Far more intelligent and agentic.\n\nI am not complaining knowing Anthropic did Windsurf bad. But the reality is that Windsurf is also intentionally putting effort to put users away from the SOTA Anthropic models.\n\nAnthropic cut 1st party access to all models. Both Sonnet 3.7 and Sonnet 4 equally. So, Windsurf can practically swap the 3.7 to 4 at no cost, as both models cost the same. Even Cursor swapped it from the default list.\n\nSo for Windsurf having 3.7 available while putting Claude 4 on BYOK only shows their intention to not put effort to have the SOTA Anthropic models, or worse their efforts to influence people away from Anthropic models, all while putting blame on Anthropic.\n\nSo, all the recent feature and UX waves are gimmicks compared to bare capability. As no UX can beat actual capability for real users. Dev's first priority is to have it write a quality code that actually works very well, UX comes next. And windsurf's vision will cost them and unnecessarily harm users.\n\nLike many users, I subscribed to Cursor just to see the comparison. Cursor UX sucks real bad. But has the capability with the power of Claude 4 models and gets the job done far better. Soon, I will hate seeing myself go, but it is what it is, and no positive thing with Windsurf's vision.\n\nFor those saying \"Why don't you use SWE-1\",  \"Why don't... Gemini\", there are many areas benchmarks can't measure and claude models (even without thinking) always practically perform far better. This is not about model comparison. It's about the distorted and costly vision of Windsurf and its future. The team knows it, not sure how long they keep this going. Maybe makes sense when considering the with the overall goal of OpenAI instead of Windsurf as independent user centric editor.\n\nThe company is now acting as a subsidized product that doesn't need to compete for devs, but only to be a shiny way to present \"their\" selected models (instead of being determined by the market+users).\n\nI hope Windsurf will be back and the team puts capability first, reconsider their vision.",

This might also change next week so I wouldn't jump ship every time a new model with 2 % better performance is released. I'll stick with Windsurf for now because of better UI/DX, planning mode, higher rate of innovation and features and that tokes last a lot longer in my experience.",

If there was a way to disable reasoning, it would just be far worse.  \nBut there is a thing with Anthropic bare models starting with sonnet 3.5 that makes them build well with  coding. The reasoning adds extra. I hate to use the inferior Cursor but couldn't usually ignore the very visible difference Claude 4 has over Gemini 06-05.  \nUsage statistics for coding on different platforms tells that too.

This seems like a bug, the file is not in gitignore and changes to it are showing up fine in the Source Control panel, It's that way for all files in my project.\n\nWorkaround: On further digging I noticed on my machine that the problem is that Windsurf is not respecting multiple (possibly nested) git directories as it should. If you hover over the Windsurf label in the lower right which is yellow telling you it's paused it also tells you the location of the .gitignore file that is pausing it. In my case it was looking at \\~/.gitignore even though my code is in a subdir with it's own .gitignore. By tweaking the .gitignore file that it's looking at you can re-enable autocomplete (and sadly break your other git repositories, but maybe that's easier to live with).",

Cascade now pairs every conversation with a live markdown plan of goals & tasks. \n\n\\- **Bidirectional updates**: edit the plan yourself or ask Cascade to tweak it – AI notifications pop if it updates the plan for you. \n\n\\- **Long-term + short-term synergy**: a larger reasoning model iterates on the plan while your chosen model handles step-by-step actions. \n\n\\- **Cheaper power**: the o3 model is now just 1x credits and runs faster in Cascade. \n\n\\- **Availability**: Planning Mode is live on all paid plans at no extra cost. \n\n\n\nThis is only Day 1. [Watch the video now](https://youtu.be/t3T_re5Q21U?si=0SCf8r-vQo83GerM).\n\nSee you tomorrow for Day 2 of Wave 10! \n\n\n\nRead the full blog here: [wave-10.com](https://windsurf.com/blog/windsurf-wave-10-planning-mode)\n\nSee the changelog here: [https://windsurf.com/changelog](https://windsurf.com/changelog) \n\n\n\n\\[[X/Twitter](https://x.com/windsurf_ai/status/1932488255674728694)\\]\n\n\\[[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/windsurfai.bsky.social/post/3lrbfqvf2bk2r)\\]\n\n\\[[Threads](https://www.threads.com/@windsurf_ai/post/DKul_gIs1NG?hl=en)\\]\n\n\\[[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKunzYJMi-0/?hl=en)\\]\n\n\\[[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7338255198412263424)\\]",

    "selftext": "Hello everyone; pretty much absolute noob vibe coder here. I've been using windsurf for the last few weeks, and initially it was pretty seamless: memories were generated both on call and automatically, and Cascade was always able to recall and incorporate them into its workflow. Over the last week or so, however, Cascade has been unable to read or write memories. Today, miraculously, it was able to do both in the morning, but it's now evening, and it's completely disclaiming any knowledge of the memory feature altogether. \n\nIs this a common problem? I can see the memories in windsurf settings, but they're not being able to be picked up by the agent. I'm running windsurf on windows 11 if that is useful. Thanks for any and all advice!",

    "selftext": "Hi Guys,\n\nSo a few days back, I took a challenge.\n\nI tried to build a AI basketball coach:\n\n1. Which can give realtime suggestions on my shots. \n\n2. Give me stats and details per shot so that I can improve. Kind of like an analytics dashboard.\n\n3. Let's me talk to it about my shots. Kind of like ChatGPT where you can reference your previous answers.\n\n  \nWas I able to do it?\n\n  \nAs an experienced dev with over 5+ years of experience, I enjoy designing and coding the frontend on my own sometimes and honestly the MVP that I built didn't even have that complex of MVP.\n\n  \nThe tough part was the entire ML side. Because I could not just send the entire thing to a multi modal LLM.\n\n  \nSo that part was challenging and it became even more challenging once I had to integrate it with flutter and if you are a flutter dev, you know that a lot of things are not well optimized for flutter.\n\n  \nLuckily I found packages from flutter-ml .dev/ who had made a converted of popular google ML packages. \n\nLoved it but since I had no idea on how to use them, i needed a quick solution.\n\n  \nSo that's where I had to use AI. I used ovalon .org 's Horizon to generate code two packages from the ML kit as it let's you chat with any package and integrate them in codebase.\n\n  \nFinally after writing some custom algo's for calculation of certain stats like release angle, ball speed, etc., this is what I built. \n\nDemo video is in the link of X post.",

    "selftext": "Okay, so... after testing Cursor and Windsurf about four months ago, I fell in love with Windsurf and decided it was *the one*. But recently, with all the hassle and the loss of Anthropic support, I’m really feeling the pain.\n\nI went on a code-vibe journey despite being a full-time dev. I just wanted to see what AI could *really* do. And I was genuinely impressed with Claude 3.7 and Windsurf — especially the agent's ability to interact with the terminal, build and update my Docker containers, etc. It was fun, even with the agents occasionally going haywire. I’d have to redirect them and keep a clean Git flow to avoid losing progress, but that was part of the ride.\n\nThen OpenAI hit, and Anthropic pulled back. I was using Claude 3.7 and Gemini 2.5 Pro extensively — they gave me the best results. Claude was better at general agent management, while Gemini was solid at broader analysis. Each had their own coding style, and both were great in their own way.\n\nBut the *major* problem: Claude 3.7 is now behind a wall and constantly failing, and Claude 4 is BYOK only. (Honestly, if Claude Code wasn't pay-per-call, I’d be all-in. so no point in going BYOK as the finance no-limit of the system is worrying for me) So I went back and tried Cursor again — and damn... with Cursor 1.0, I’m getting a similar experience to what I had on Windsurf months ago, now powered by a much more capable Claude 4.0. (Still Claude, so yeah, it loves spawning random files, but it’s noticeably more concise — you can tell they’ve worked on it.). It just works, gives me code and explination of what it's doing, and I can test it and get it to read my readme for context.\n\nSo yeah... just wanted to say: Sorry, Windsurf. I really loved what you built — especially the memory feature, which I’ll miss the most. But losing Anthropic is a dealbreaker for me. 😞",

        "body": "I'm in a similar situation to you. I started with Cursor, moved to Windsurf, and am now going back to Cursor to try out 1.0. I think overall I like Windsurf as a piece of software more, but as you say the models are a dealbreaker. \n\nThat said, I also think models are the most replaceable part of the whole thing. All you need to do is swap out the API key (ok it gets a bit more complicated than that with optimising context for certain models, but on the whole it's not a huge piece of work).\n\nAnd we're getting a new model what? Once every two weeks? Something like that anyway. Claude 4 is the shit right now but it won't be forever. As the models get smarter and get cheaper to run I expect we'll see better integrations with both pieces of software. (Cursor has had it's own problems with model support. One of the reasons I moved off it initially was it's lackluster Gemini 2.5 pro integration. But you know, new model every two weeks, Gemini 2.5 pro is old shit now it's all Claude lol).\n\nSo while I'm moving off it for now, I'll keep an eye on both it and Cursor and whatever other new solutions come out and use whatever is best at that time. Looking forward to SWE-2 or w/e they come out with. And even without the peak performance of Claude, I do think Windsurf has best value for money with SWE-1 right now (since it's literally free lol and while not perfect is a pretty strong general purpose coding assistant).",

Thank goodness it's not pulling that move much lately but it's still gets confused when there are large tracts of code involving nested brackets.\n\nAnother quirk is that it starts to want to take over terminal and start doing targeted searches and doing other terminal gymnastics and often fails in the end to reconcile the brackets, and I have to revert several prompts and start over again.

It happens quite regularly.   \n  \nI've been just taking small steps and committing to git earlier than I'd like just so I can roll back and start again when this happens. I've come to recognise some warning signs, like it seems to be running very slow, taking a longer than usual time to write sentences. If it starts repeating statements to the chat and the syntax errors start piling up and I have to hit \"continue\" more than once, it's usually a sign that it might be better to pull the plug early, revert, and try again, trying to see if the prompt can be improved.\n\nSome of it may be prompt writing, but I'd say there's definitely a technical fault that is not user error somewhere in the chain.",

    "selftext": "Don't give me so much credibility, im just a noob vibe coder, but since i was somewhat forced to test Gemini because Claude was being throttled ive seen it do super complex stuff I was always afraid to do with Claude, let alone other models.\n\nWhile working with claude, tho to be fair, a bit throttled, it bulked up one of the pages in my app to about 900 lines. then started using Gemini and though i thought it was destroying it, i decided to save everything, commit, and let it work, and it got it down to 500 lines of code, doing exactly the same, more snippy, looking exactly the same. And its been pretty solid since then. Tho i should clear up ive always been using Claude, 3.5 and 3.7 on windsurf, with good results but nothing so dramatic, so im not just talking about its current state on windsurf.\n\nI lost about 3-4 days trying to solve stuff with SWE and trying to figure out if Claude was on a good day or not. But nah, should have gone with Gemini from the start. If the claude 4s are substantially better than this Gemini i really think apps will be really just a matter of a lot of good design ideas, solid architecture and time for bug control. Finally after 6 months i feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel and there wont be a hard wall i cant break for my current project. Thanks, Gemini... i guess, at least until i decide to pay for claude 4 and whatever comes next.",

I am also not sure about the context for templates I am giving to it. For example: I've compressed a large repository to a single file readable by any LLM with the help of \\`repomix\\` but if it actually uses that file to understand and generate the nuclei templates.

I have to tell it in the chat about what he has done wrong everytime I open a new conversation just because previous ones have messed up a lot. So, there was a very basic instruction on \"references\" in swagger file, I asked it to resolve the references and add required files in \"request body\", it did the same 2-3 times and later started using \"User object\" as a value of \"request body\" instead of resolving what actually does this User object contains. \n\nAdditionally, I guess providing a context of repository that contains more than 50k+ lines would be too much for windsurf atm. My usecase involves providing context on how to write DAST related YAML templates and the nuclei's repository is too big, when gave this repo. to \\`repomix\\` it produced a 32Mb file with more than 1Lakh+ lines.",

For each JavaScript file (`background.js`, `blacklist.js`, `common.js`, `directory.js`, `popup.js`, `storage.js`):\n        1. Analyze for inefficiencies specific to the codebase, including:\n            - Overly long functions, deeply nested logic, or redundant code patterns (e.g., repeated selector logic).\n            - Inefficient DOM querying or polling (e.g., repeated queries inside loops).\n            - Poor separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI code).\n            - Unclear error handling or lack of defensive programming (e.g., missing null checks).\n            - Non-idiomatic use of async/await (e.g., missing try/catch, not using await where appropriate).\n            - Inefficient storage fragmentation/merging logic (see `storage.js`).\n            - Non-robust parsing/matching logic (see `directory.js` blacklist/category/tag handling).\n            - Unclear or inconsistent logging/debugging (e.g., check usage of `logInfo`, `logWarn`, etc.).\n        2. If inefficiencies exist, refactor using VS Code tools and:\n            - Break up long functions into smaller, testable units.\n            - Extract reusable DOM selector logic into utility functions.\n            - Ensure all async code has proper error handling.\n            - Use efficient fragment and merge logic for storage (see `storage.js`).\n            - Apply consistent logging and error messaging patterns.\n            - Repeat step 2 for the current file until no further inefficiencies are detected.\n\n3. **Do until no errors are introduced:**\n    1. Run the linter (matching the project's settings) and all available tests after each refactor.\n    2. If errors or test failures occur:\n        - Revert the last change or isolate the source of failure.\n        - Repeat this step, ensuring all tests and linter checks pass before proceeding.\n\n4. **For each completed refactor, format output in markdown:**\n    - **Refactorings**: List of changes made per file (e.g., \"Split `filterAllContent` into three functions\", \"Consolidated error handling in async storage functions\").\n    - **Metrics**: Quantitative or qualitative improvements (e.g., function length reduced, code duplication eliminated, improved test coverage, performance notes).\n    - **Validation**: Summary of linter/test results (e.g., \"All tests pass; no new linter warnings\").\n\n#### Additional Enforcement (based on the codebase):\n\n- Respect the repository's pattern of using modular helper functions for logging and storage.\n- Maintain and improve the robustness of DOM selectors, especially those that are context-aware or handle SPA navigation (see `directory.js`).\n- Preserve the blacklist's flexible term-matching logic (exact, loose, regex) and ensure the refactor does not break user-facing filtering features.\n- Retain and improve async handling for Chrome extension APIs, ensuring all storage and messaging operations are reliable and debuggable.\n- Keep all localizations, UI feedback, and accessibility improvements intact.\n- Document any changes that alter the public API between scripts, especially those impacting content scripts, popups, or background events.\n\n---\n_Follow these steps for every code writing or refactoring task in the `unwanted-twitch/scripts` directory. Do not exit the loop until code meets both general optimization criteria and the specific structural/architectural patterns analyzed above._\n\n\n\nI Use the following prompt in github copilot web to have github reference my code base and use the existing methodologies to tailor the instruction prompt to my specific code (which can be applied to any github repo's codebase)\n\n\n```\nUse the analysis of the @SevWren/unwanted-twitch/files/scripts  codebase to tailor the following system instructions prompt to the @SevWren/unwanted-twitch  codebase  ```\n### System Instruction Prompt: Ordered List with Do-Until Loops for Refactoring\n**Objective**: Force the LLM IDE agent to refactor code in VS Code until optimized.\n\n1.

However, here are a few best practices that can help reduce the frequency of this issue:**\n\n>\\- Wait a few moments between sending requests, especially after a long response or heavy tool usage.\n\n>\\- Start a new conversation if the current one gets too long or complex. This helps reduce memory overhead and speeds up processing.\n\n>\\- Switch models (e.g., to a lighter or more responsive one) — this can also help avoid model-specific rate or context limitations.\n\n>We fully understand how disruptive this can be, particularly when working on complex or time-sensitive tasks. Please know that we’re actively working with our model providers to increase rate limits and improve overall reliability for all users.\n\n> \n\n>Thanks again for your patience, and feel free to reach out if you encounter further issues or need help adjusting your workflow to work around this for now.\n\n  \nIn my case, Gemini was thinking for a long time, because I was asking challenging things, so it timed out every time, probably also because that day Google released new version, so demand was high.",

    "selftext": "Long ago I was a coder. 2003 was my last year doing it for pay. Despite inventing techniques in SQL, Access and LabView that even developers didn't know were possible, it turns out I have some limitations; terrible semantic memory (I forget facts over time) coupled with Inattentive ADD (I'm wired to viscerally hate the mundane, like reading walls of code or tedious file management). It's like being a rockstar sportsball player, but with debilitating athsma. I'm better at it than the average Joe, but I can't maintain it.   \n  \nI \"get\" coding. I co-taught my first ever Pascal class in college halfway through the class, it was so obvious to me. But if you can't build upon the past, you're forever Groundhog Daying your skills. In the same way I hate having to re-re-re-learn game controls, my brain loathes relearning old code, and it can't retain advanced techniques. \n\nWhat it CAN do is hyperfocus on new and interesting work. If it's novel, not boring and I'm passionate about it, I'll devote my life to it, or at least days on end. It's a different type of superpower. It's what fuels my entrepreneurial lifestyle. \n\nEnter Windsurf. Since I've not had the pleasure of keeping up with coding beyone the odd VB customizations and on-demand html stuff, I'm not versed in any tools or techniques developed since 2003. But with Ai as my copilot/mule my ideas can be realized autonomously, and with WS's file management abilities, the tedious work is off loaded, and I can just put my thoughts to code without literally dying of mundaneitis.\n\nWindsurf is the mental wheelchair that allows me to code again. Vibe coding is my only hope. It's a brain executive function thing. Undefeatable, but not insurmountable. \n\nSo, thanks to Windsurf for putting the pieces together to allow neuro-spicy brains the opportunity to play. I've since built some hairy projects in short order, from an Access-based CRM with Kanban, a notion knowledgebase with automatic video transcription and summarization, some websites and scraping tools, one-off hacks, and currently a course creation tool for augmenting my sieve of a brain with permanent storage. I'm the human equivalent of having a small context window needing readme files to stay focused. \n\nIt may not be for everyone, but for me it's everything. ",

I got into BI development which I love but tools like Windsurf and Lovable have brought back my interest in app development. I’m just wrapping up a commercial product using Lovable. I’ve created Udemy courses on both products and, at the moment, Lovable is my preferred tool. Lovable is actually quite amazing, but Windsurf is probably a better tool if you like being “closer to the metal”. I’m a little concerned about what the OpenAI acquisition is going to do to Windsurf. A couple weeks ago I was trying to wrap up a demo project with Windsurf and its stability just got real bad.",

You already have the money and the overpriced engineers now use the brains.\n\nAfter the whole Claude drama and the ripple effects it caused not just for you, but for *us* users using your product this is your chance to flip the script.\n\nJust saw the new paper on the Darwin Gödel Machine (https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22954) .it’s a self-improving agent that can evolve and rewrite its own code, empirically validate improvements, and keep getting better forever. actually working Gödel Machine . they took the ideas from evolution, but focused on code. And it works.\n\nHere's the thing: this tech just needs compute(money) and time and you has both. You take SWE-1 and plug it into this open ended, self-improving loop. Use the Darwin Gödel architecture to make SWE-1 not just good, but the best.\n\nThe framework is ready. The pieces are all there. Make SWE-1 evolve.\n\nDon't just build another static model. Build an agent that learns how to make itself better evolve and beat claude. and of curse if it works give me free account forever;)",

So maybe something like that is preventing it. **Either way the random order  would only cause them to appear in random bottom, middle, or top order, and we want completely random positioning, unrelated to the last one, or to the matrix number, or to anything at all,** its just simply randomly placed a few points away vertically and horizontally from their common reference point, for all of them equally.\n\n>RevertThought Process\n\nWindsurf/Claude 3.7 thinking.\n\n>I understand the issue now.

Was burning through credits restarting projects constantly.\n\nThis sparked the idea to build CodeBreaker - a tool that gives developers proven prompts to reset AI thinking when it gets confused. Instead of restarting your whole coding session, you get specific prompts that actually get the AI back on track.\n\nBuilt the whole thing using the AI tools it's designed to fix, which was pretty ironic but worked well once I learned better prompting techniques.\n\nReplit Agent is getting way better but you still need to know how to communicate with it properly to avoid the endless debugging loops.\n\nFeel free to ask questions about AI prompting strategies, and if you're dealing with stuck AI assistants, check it out.\n\nGo save some time and credits guys....hope it helps improve your dev workflow.\n\n[code-breaker.org](http://code-breaker.org)",

    "selftext": "Over the past few weeks, it feels like Windsurf has seriously degraded. The agent is struggling with even basic file edits, and cascade errors are popping up *way* more — like 10x what they used to be.\n\nJust a month ago I built a full app as a test for vibe coding with zero issues. Now, every tiny edit either takes forever or straight-up crashes half the time.\n\nI'm based in Europe, and crashes seem worse in the afternoon — basically when the US comes online — which makes me think this could be a scaling problem. I'm on a pro plan, so that’s extra frustrating and concerning.\n\nFor context:\n\n* I usually use **Claude 3.7** for agent stuff, file manipulation, and command work — it’s the only one that handles it well (still waiting on a proper Claude 4 agent though).\n* I use **Gemini** for more precise code stuff, though in my experience it struggles with multiple files and bash commands.\n\nI can deal with the usual LLM quirks like bad terminal output — annoying but whatever. But these constant cascade errors? They’re becoming subscription-canceling level bad.",

And the coding style is less verbose than sonnet.\n\n\nEven if Anthropic messe things up, I believe due to the cut throat AI competition, we will always have good models. But I too feel that Anthropic is being asshole in behaving that wag, especially after all the safety and alignment they preach.\n\n\nRegarding making the new files issue, I also face with other models. Sometimes models go as far as to import variables from old file to utilize it in a new file. Again this might be windsurf agent or some LLM behaviour to reduce context length per file.

    "selftext": "If you don't know, you can use Claude Code inside of your editor whether that is Windsurf, VS Code, etc. \n\nI was a huge windsurf stan for months but after the OpenAI acquisition and change to the billing structure it went massively downhill in quality. \n\nClaude 3.7 used to work miracles and then I suspect that Windsurf changed how the context window works and started relying on 'rules' instead while they got rid for the $60/mo plan and started pushing gpt 4.1. \n\nWindsurf has become so much less fun and satisfying to use since that has happened. I am PRAYING it gets back to how it felt 2 months ago, but in the meantime I'm using Claude Code in my terminal in place of Cascade while still using Windsurf's other built in features like autocomplete and it feels like Windsurf felt before it started going downhill. \n\nI have faith in the team to address our complaints but until then, I'm on team Claude Code. The only thing that sucks is now that instead of paying $60 for a premium experience, I'm paying $215 for windsurf + Claude code together but it's worth it for a job I spend 60 hours a week for. \n\nI will also say that using Claude 4 with the BYOK model with Cascade is still somehow giving me worse results than using Claude Code in the terminal inside of Windsurf instead of Cascade with the exact same prompt. You can test it yourself. Give it a prompt with Cascade and Claude 4 sonnet, review the changes and ditch them. Give it the same prompt in Claude code, and then see how much better the results are. Plus- Claude code warns you when it is about to compress the context for you. \n\nAll of this is to say that it seems like being purchased by OpenAI screwed us over as users and the worst part is that they deny it to us here and it doesn't feel good. Just charge us more money, include the leading models with the plan even if they're owned by your competitor, give us more context, listen to our feedback, and please make Windsurf fun to use again. Please. \n\nI do have to point out that the UI and DX of Windsurf where you can see the diff directly in the editor and approve it line by line or file by file is WAY more intuitive than Claude code so I have my fingers crossed that they improve for us all. \n\nI love OpenAI, I really like Windsurf, neither of them have lost me as a customer yet but it's starting to feel more like a stale marriage instead of the honeymoon from earlier in the year.

So may require a few extra credits to keep it going. \n** Actually the reason it stopped is because it ran into the deadline exceeded error that seems to be a known issue right now. Which also seems to be related to long running tools.  Having it break larger files into multiple tool calls (create skeleton, edit with components) helps.  Switching to SWE-1 seems more stable right now and doing great.  But the issues are unrelated to this onboarding workflow",

As Cloudflare documentation isn't a \"built-in\" amongst the docs you can query in Windsurf (I think Cursor has this feature to query some docs?), I utilised Windsurf's capabilities to overcome this. I had already enabled Brave's MCP for search just in case it needs to search the web for a solution.\n\nI then simply pasted the link to the relevant documentation page into the Windsurf chat, along with my question. The AI understood how to use this information far more effectively than I could have managed on my own.\n\nLooking ahead, if I want to work with another technology and would like Windsurf to refer to its specific documentation automatically without me manually pasting the link one by one, what would be the most effective way to achieve this?\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hi folks,\n\nI've been experimenting with the **Taskmaster MCP server** inside Windsurf for the last few days and I'm both amazed and frustrated. Here's my current workflow:\n\n- I give a high-level prompt.\n- Taskmaster kicks in and breaks it down into manageable tasks, even going so far as to make subtasks for each one in some cases.\n- This part feels magical – the break down is *almost perfect*.\n\nBUT… when I try to tackle each task one by one, by opening a **new cascade per task**, things start falling apart:\n\n- The cascade seems to **lose track of the overall context**.\n- Some tasks just **freeze**, showing no progress.\n- Others seem to **execute incorrectly** or return poor outputs.\n- And by the time I’m through 10–15 subtasks, the whole system is out of sync and **Windsurf can’t proceed** meaningfully. I've had to scrap entire projects and start from scratch again.\n\nIt's becoming unmanageable. The initial excitement around task structuring is being replaced by frustration that nothing is actually *getting done*. 😕\n\nHas anyone figured out a better way to **chain the task executions** or avoid these breakdowns?\n  \nAre there any internal settings, workflows, or sequencing tips that make the Taskmaster experience *actually productive* in Windsurf?\n\nWould love to hear from others using this setup or tips to get the best out of Windsurf.\n\nThank you,",

So, you have to save your work just like you have to save your documents, then ask the new Ai session to review the saved files so it is brought up to speed again. I make a readme file and tell it: \"read readme\". That's all it takes, as long as you leave appropriate breadcrumbs in the file as or if needed.\n\nAsk ChatGPT, Claude and Perplexity variations of this question: How do I best maintain project status when I start a new conversation? The more you ask Ai instead of us 1) the faster you'll get your answers, 2) the faster your knowledge will compound as you build upon the meaty answers and ask follow-up questions. Use Ai as your professor, coach, therapist, etc. Until you are a true wizard at coding the Ai will be an asset to draw knowledge from as well as a tool for development. Even as a wizard it's still true. \n\nI'm currently using a three agent workflow: [console.Anthropic.com](http://console.Anthropic.com) as my \"expert\" guiding my project, Windsurf as the coding mule and Task-Master as... the task master.   \n  \nAsk Windsurf to add git to your project and ask it to commit as you go. It will set it up for you so you can learn that process if you haven't. That allows for recalling previous versions when you want to back up and try again. \n\nWhen you have a process that you have been struggling with finally work, ask the Ai to document the working process in a \"Proven Process\" file, or whatever. Your choice.  \n\nSounds like you're not making the mistake of adding a thousand Do's and Don'ts to bloat the context so much it chokes the ai, and refreshing the context often. Just saving your progress will get you that much further along.\n\nCaveat: I don't know what I'm talking about. I just ask Ai. I'm actually you in the future.",

Yes I understand that we want to rely on AI to do this for us, fix our issues and create the amazing idea we have.

    "selftext": "One of the most frustrating parts of working inside Agentic AI IDEs is when you hit a point where the agent’s changes didn’t go the way you expected… and now dozens of files are modified. You’re stuck thinking:\n\n“How do I even restart from a clean state without nuking everything?”\n\nI’ve run into this enough times that I started baking versioning checkpoints into the workflow itself.\n\nHere’s the move: I prompted Cascade with this instruction —\n\n“Add process instructions in a .md file to help us commit every major step and use consistent tag names so we can easily undo if something breaks.”\n\nCascade responded with a complete plan:\n\n\t•\tDedicated feature branch\n\n\t•\tCommit prefixes like test:, feat:, etc.\n\n\t•\tMilestone tag naming: BigFeature-[step]-[date]\n\n\t•\tUndo commands using git reset\n\n\t•\tFinal merge process with --no-ff\n\n\nHere’s a sample of what it added:\n\n## Version Control Strategy\r\n\r\n### Commit and Tagging Conventions\r\n\r\nTo maintain a clean and reversible development process, we'll follow these version control practices:\r\n\r\n#### Branch Strategy\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Create feature branch for BigFeature implementation \ngit checkout -b feature/BigFeature\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Commit Conventions\r\n\r\nUse descriptive commit messages with prefixes:\r\n\r\n- `test:` - Test-related changes\r\n- `feat:` - New feature implementation\r\n- `refactor:` - Code restructuring\r\n- `docs:` - Documentation updates\r\n\r\n#### Checkpoint Tags\r\n\r\nAfter each major milestone, create a tag to serve as a checkpoint:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Tag naming convention: BigFeature-[milestone]-[date]\r\ngit tag -a BigFeature-[milestone]-[date] -m \"[Description]\"\n```\n#### Reversion Process\r\n\r\nIf needed, revert to a specific checkpoint:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Soft reset to a specific tag (preserves changes as unstaged)\r\ngit reset [tag-name]\r\n\r\n# Hard reset to a specific tag (discards all changes)\r\ngit reset --hard [tag-name]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Feature Completion and Merge Process\r\n\r\nOnce the feature is complete and all tests pass, merge the feature branch back to the main branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Ensure you're on the feature branch with latest changes\r\ngit checkout feature/BigFeature\r\ngit pull\r\n\r\n# Run tests to verify everything works\r\nnpm test\r\n\r\n# Switch to the main branch and update it\r\ngit checkout main\r\ngit pull\r\n\r\n# Merge the feature branch (--no-ff preserves feature branch history)\r\ngit merge --no-ff feature/stalling-day -m \"Merge feature/BigFeature: Add BigFeature\"\r\n\r\n# Push changes to remote repository\r\ngit push\r\n\r\n# Create a release tag (optional)\r\ngit tag -a v1.0.35 -m \"Version 1.0.35 - Add BigFeature\"\r\ngit push --tags\r\n```\n\nHonestly, this saves me from headaches every time a cascade session gets chaotic.\n\nCurious how others are handling rollback or damage control with these tools — got a better system?

However, today I asked Sonnet 4 (thinking, had to by a few BYOK credits) to create a Python monotonic timer class with an extend() method that allows me to extend the timeout. It provided a decent class but was waking up every 100 milliseconds to do polling to handle the extend request. I hate polling and asked it that was really necessary. I got some explanation followed by \"The current design is elegant in its simplicity and robustness. *Sometimes the \"****naive****\" approach is the best approach!*\" Oh, those are fighting words.\n\nI went to Gemini 2.5 (flash) to ask the same question. I got a very nice implementation with NO polling. The solution used a condition variable which was nicely done. Gemini even added a try-except block around the timer callback. which Sonnet should have done. I went back to Sonnet and asked, \"how about using a condition variable\" and the response was \"**Excellent idea!**  Using`threading.Condition with wait() and notify_all()`would be a **much more elegant solution** than polling!\" Ya think so....",

In theory it shouldn't break anything to switch models mid-chat, and it can even be helpful because you can get to a different 'starting point' with a certain model that you're less likely to have reached with a fresh chat. However, sometimes tool calls are more likely to have issues when you switch models. (Different models process schemas differently, so performance isn't always consistent.) Your mileage may vary.",

Otherwise, the main module is pointing to other JAR versions instead the local ones\n\nThe funny part was that the Windsurf plugin only let me access things from a random module that was first on the module's list. Not even the main one, which could have made sense, since this is the one with the .idea file I think\n\nAnyhow, the workaround for now is in IntelliJ:\n\n\\- to load the parent folder of the \"main\" module. This folder contains the clone of the repos we work on, with all the modules inside\n\n\\- Change the Application config so it will match the new structure IntelliJ is now aware of\n\n\\- Load your other modules as usual (Gradle\\\\Maven\\\\Whatever)\n\n  \nWhile the workaround is working, it seems to be very slow, I believe it has something to do with having visibility to all of the files from the repos we clone, and not just the specific modules we want to work on",

But, mocking those hooks was quite cumbersome. So, I got windsurf to refactor some.components to create a default that matched the existing API, then used hooks to collate the data to pass to a 'core' version. It's this 'core' version that windsurf wrote stories against.",

    "selftext": "The best efficiency hack for me is to brainstorm with 04 mini high, and figure out an approach to the bug, architecture, or feature. Once I am confident about an approach, depending on if it's a large implementation, I'll have it write a plan in a directory, and then I switch to 3.7 thinking or 2.5 pro for the implementation.\n\nLately, I've been preferring 3.7 because for me it addresses the issues without wandering off and adding random \"nice-to-haves\" that frankly ruin the UI or some other aspect of the code. 2.5 is more intelligent by experience, but it tends to wander off and work on other things that are not related. Adding \"stick to the request and don't 'color outside the lines'\" is something I've had to do more often, maybe because my codebase is growing, but I don't know.\n\ngrok is basically useless imo and i have not found a way to meaningfully use the free models because of the lower Intelligence and poor tool usage compared to the newer models. \n\nanother pro tip is to break down tasks in small chunks. maybe phases. i get more utility out of the models with this approach. \n\nWhat are your efficiency hacks?",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nAt this moment, I'm manually building apps. I'm still pretty basic, but I'm going through the motions and actually building things. Windsurf keeps asking for permission to do X or Y or Z about 100 times a day.\n\nAfter the 10th time across multiple apps (some that worked, some that didn’t), I started thinking — **why am I even part of the loop?**\n\nIf I’ve given it the instructions, told it what I want, and I’m not working on anything high-stakes, why can’t it just... do its thing? Why does it need me there to bless every install, every command, every single step?\n\nMy question is **Can Windsurf do everything and show me once its done?**\n\nAll I really want is:\n- A **safe sandbox mode**\n- Where it **tries everything**, runs wild, tests, retries, debugs, **no hand-holding**\n\n- And when it’s done, I come back and look at the output and then iterate.\nI’m not asking it to deploy to prod or ship to users. I just want to see what it would build **if it didn’t keep stopping to ask me questions**.\n\nTo all the more experienced folks here:\n**Have you figured this out? Is there some hidden Windsurf setting, workflow, or plugin that allows for full hands-off autonomy in a sandboxed environment?**\n\nAppreciate any pointers.\n\nThank you for reading.",

I have it editing files where it works on a routine, and then it will ask for the location of the routine a few steps later.  Like, it just scanned a 2000 line file, and found the routine, and made changes.  and then 5 minutes later, when more changes are needed, it scans the file again.  It doesn't remember basic locations of code.  It does not seem to be cognizant of what's in the chat either.  I'll say \"scan the chat for {the thing we're talking about}\" and it comes up huh?  \n\nSwitching back to Claude 3.7  ",

    "selftext": "Probably the most frustrating error I find across models is the tendency (Gemini by far the worst offender but they're all pretty bad in this respect) for the models to rush to completion. \n\nIt reminds me of dealing with the worst tech support team I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with in my first job out of college. Every ticket we raised was marked \"solved\" in 5 minutes. Things were rarely fixed.\n\nThe usual interaction flow with Cascade goes something like this:\n\nMe:  Do X, Y, Z please. \n\nModel: <---- Does some stuff --->\n\nThen - frequently - comes what I will term \"the burst.\"\n\nJust at the point when you want to ... check out what's been done ... the completion cascade kicks off and the model gleefully announces that it has completed the task flawlessly. \n\nOnly ... the dev server is broken and the site is not loading. \n\nSo the user ends up writing something like:\n\n\"Actually you just detroyed my codebase. So, no. I wouldn't really say that we're done..!\"\n\nWhat would be cool/nice is *human in the loop* by default. This seems to happen occasionally though eratically. The model asks for confirmation that the task has been completed successfully which - even if it hasn't - at least saves the frustration of the other experience.\n\nI guess what I'm askign: why does this happen? And if it's inherent in the \"under the hood\" system prompting we ahve no control over can it be mitigated against by Windsurf Rules to any extent?\n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m working on a React Native Expo app and using Windsurf to speed things up. I’ll be honest—I don’t have much experience with RN coding, but I do know exactly what I want my app to do. So far, I’ve just been giving my requirements to Cascade, letting it generate the code, and then piecing things together in a modular way. I do manually pushing my code to my github repo for VC  whenever a new feature is integrated without breaking the application.\n\nNow I’ve been hearing about MCP (Model Context Protocol) and I’m wondering how it could fit into my workflow.\n\nI’m curious:\n\nWhat are some MCP tools or practices that could help someone like me?\n\nCan MCP make my life easier when it comes to building, scaling, or organizing stuff?\n\nAny examples of how you’ve used MCP in your own projects?\n\n\nI’m still learning, so any tips, tools, or real-world use cases would be super helpful. Hoping this post helps other folks like me who are trying to build real apps without being deep into the code all the time.\n\nThanks in advance!",

It was about 6 and I’d been coding my fuckin dick off all afternoon.\n\n“*I’m a high tech vibe rater*,” I replied, “*And I rate this tech high vibe an 8/10.*”\n\nA few hours later, the vibe had changed.\n\nI was right in the middle of a reptile zoo, and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things. It wouldn’t be long til they tore me to shreds!\n\nI got too deep in the vibe, took my eye off the ball, and the whole thing spun out of control.\n\nI had 30 files in my change log with hours of work uncommitted. It was a *fuckup cascade*.\n\nI let the agent make a wrong change, because I didn’t carefully review everything it did. One var got renamed incorrectly. That led to another wrong change, propagating the bad var renaming through another file.\n\nI was ass-up and sliding sideways hard.\n\nI didn’t want to roll back and lose an entire day of work! What could I do?\n\n**Take a Deep Breath — It’s Easier Than It Looks**\n\nAll you gotta do is *slow down*, recenter, and work the problem.\n\n[https://medium.com/@TimSylvester/how-to-pull-out-of-a-vibe-tailspin-700166b1d285](https://medium.com/@TimSylvester/how-to-pull-out-of-a-vibe-tailspin-700166b1d285)",

I’m not talking about learning an entire language just learn how to explain it so that the Ai understands what it is that you want it to do.  \n\nMy suggestion is this:\n\nCreate a sketch or use Figma for the design \nUse Mermaid code for the logic\nLearn about the tools Ai needs to make code work: ie search the web, fetch data from a database etc. \n\nMaybe Windsurf would be best used by you in the Chat mode asking it to explain how to do these things.

Your most precious asset is your brain in architecting and planning the app, and managing the AI. The bigger the project goes, the longer you have to spend on planning and architecting your product. And obviously double-checking all of the content of your folders, run tests to make sure AI always stick to your project flow requirements.",

    "selftext": "I’m using JetBrains Rider with a Windsurf Pro subscription and the Windsurf plugin. Unlike in the Windsurf default editor, the plugin in Rider doesn’t seem to pick up the clipboard contents. For example, if I open the same file and cut a block from the middle with Ctrl+X, Rider offers completions that don’t take the removed code into account, whereas the default editor recognizes what I just cut and tailors its suggestions accordingly. This difference makes the two editors feel like completely separate experiences and has me wondering whether I should switch back to the default editor.\n\nIs this behavior intentional, or do I have something misconfigured? I’m already comfortable in the JetBrains IDE and don’t want to move to the VS Code fork. Has anyone else run into the same issue?",

However if you would like you would follow the Agents and let them do all the work and when bugs arise combat them with dedicated Debug Agents.... essentially what im trying to say is that it's very adaptive to your any kind of work!\n\nAlso, the reason I didn't opt an MCP memory server like task master is that a call to an mcp server tool = one request on almost all AI IDEs nowadays! so 1 request to access the memory system to get context, one more to generate the prompt and then 1 more to actually implement it ( maybe needing to access further memory logs so maybe more than 1 ) ... in practice its always 3+ requests when using an MCP server in a Multi Agent system per step, vs just 2 if you just attached required context in the prompt!",

    "title": "Why I Switched to Windsurf as My All-in-One Writing & Coding Tool",
    "selftext": "I write every day. I like to keep it simple, so I started with vim & git at the command line. Recently I also tried Obsidian with vim motions and a git plugin to edit my Markdown files.\n\nBut, switching to a separate browser window to ask the AI some questions is especially tedious when I'm using the LLM to help me untangle some `git` merge nightmare at the command line, or figuring out the options I want for a command like `ffmpeg`. Using an LLM to work with the command line is the best.\n\nThat's what led me to use Windsurf as my \"integrated AI & CLI interface.\" That in turn made it trivial to turn a tricky bash command into a script, or to take notes about what I was doing so I might remember the next time.\n\nThen I realized: wait a minute, I've got access to all of the best AI frontier models right here, built into the Windsurf UI. \n\n- I can highlight text and ask the AI to help me edit it.\n- I can write out a question, and just highlight it & press `Cmd+L` to turn it into a prompt.\n- I can chat with the AI to brainstorm ideas, or headlines, without having to switch over to my browser.\n\nThese are the exact writing tools that I want in my text editor to help me write, not just code.\n\nI needed to make a few tweaks to get it all to be just the way I like it when I'm writing instead of coding:\n\n- Turned off autocomplete in the Windsurf settings: I like to write the first draft myself, then let the LLM help me edit.\n- Set Cascade to \"Chat\" mode instead of \"Write\" mode.\n- Select DeepSeek V3 as my default model -- it's free so I can chat without worrying about using up my credits I'll want to use for coding.\n- Added a word count and date stamp plugin to make it just like vim and Obsidian.\n- Installed a Wiki-links extension so I can create and follow links in my Markdown files. \n\nThis is the huge advantage of using Markdown as the open file format for my writing: I can use the best editor for the job, or switch from one to another depending on what I want to focus on. \n\nVim is still my go-to for undistracted writing (the Zen mode in Windsurf is a close second, though) and Obsidian is great for navigating and creating my wiki links.\n\nBut Windsurf is fast becoming my favorite writing tool. Bonus: I don't have to do a mental \"mode shift\" when I switch between writing and coding, because I'm using the same app for both.",

Other models are worse with it (especially OpenAI models)\n\nThe problem is our own assumption that every AI is trained well on every third party library (like Clerk) out there which is simply not true unfortunately (and you find it out the hard way).\n\nWhat helps when being stuck with Clerk  \n\\* Read the manual of Clerk  \n\\* Stackoverflow etc.  \n\\* find similar code with google or in github.  \n\\* there is probably also some Clerk community or chat somewhere?  \n\\* maybe reference to Clerk documentation in your AI?\n\nSo I would say you've hit a corner case but Gemini is okayish with Clerk.\n\nAI is not always the best for third party libraries because it can be literally they've never looked at them closely during their training / when they were created!",

This allows for more intuitive coding interactions compared to Cursor and Windsurf, which may require more structured prompts.\n\t2.\tIntegrated Code Reasoning\nClaude Code excels in maintaining logical coherence across large codebases. Its ability to track variable scope, function relationships, and broader architectural patterns outperforms Cursor’s real-time assist and Windsurf’s lightweight suggestions.\n\t3.\tStrong Context Retention\nWith extended context windows, Claude Code handles larger files and multi-step tasks with greater continuity. Cursor and Windsurf have more limited memory, which can disrupt long or layered coding workflows.\n\t4.\tSecurity and Alignment\nClaude Code incorporates Anthropic’s safety research, offering secure code suggestions aligned with best practices, minimizing the risk of insecure or biased code. This level of alignment is less robust in Cursor and Windsurf.\n\t5.\tCross-Disciplinary Flexibility\nClaude Code supports a broader range of technical and non-technical queries, making it more suitable for developers who integrate engineering with documentation, product planning, or legal review — areas where Cursor and Windsurf are less effective.",

Why Claude continues to work with Cursor I do not know, because they have the same problems every new AI model released, and this is not the first or second time. But probably Cursor is a competitor to Windsurf and that's probably why.  \n\nOn the other hand, one thing bothers me, does Windsurf actually have to negotiate with Claude? There are many other providers that provide AI models through APIs like edenai.co or fireworks.\nI think OpenAI is big and serious enough that it would negotiate with one of these companies a really great price if only in exchange for a cheaper supply of ChatGPT models, however, this is just a dream, because it is an additional cost.\n\nI just bought Windsurf pro and feel bad that just at this time Claude released a new model that I don't have access to",

    "selftext": "Yesterday Anthropic dropped Claude Opus 4. As a Claude fanboy, I was pumped.\n\nWindsurf immediately added support. Perfect timing.\n\nSo, I asked it to build a complex feature.\nResult: Absolutely perfect.\nOne shot. No back-and-forth. No debugging.\n\nThen I checked my usage: $7.31 for one task. One feature request.\n\nThe math just hit me:\nWindsurf makes you use your own API key (BYOK). Smart move on their part.\n\t•\tThey charge: $15/month for the tool\n\t•\tI paid: $7.31 per Opus 4 task directly to Anthropic\n\t•\tTotal cost: $15 + whatever I burn through\n\nIf I do 10 tasks a day, that’s $76 daily. Plus the $15 monthly fee.\n\n$2300/month just to use Windsurf with Opus 4.\n\nNo wonder they switched to BYOK.\nThey’d be bankrupt otherwise.\n\nThe quality is undeniable. But price per task adds up fast.\n\nEither AI pricing drops. Or coding with top-tier AI becomes can be a luxury only big companies can afford.\n\nAre you cool with $2000+/month dev tool costs? Or is this the end of affordable AI coding assistance?",

Switch to Sonnet if you want better pricing. From my understanding, Anthropic gave Windsurf bulk API pricing which made it more affordable for us using the built in credit based system, but I guess there is a hiccup with getting the new models added so they gave us the option to use our own key in the mean time. People are acting like this will always be the only way to use the new models. I find that unlikely. Just have a little a patience, I'm sure they want to bring the new models to their customer base just as bad as we want it.",

Using direct Claude/Claude code takes usually 2-3 prompts to finish, and using Cursor Sonnet takes usually more prompts. In the easy bugs, it's usually the same as direct Claude (1 prompt) but in more complex problems I need at least 2 more prompts to finish. So for example, 5 UI bugs take 2 prompts using Claude directly, and Cursor took 5 prompts to finish SAME problems.\nI had a very complex audio problem in the app which was fixed using Claude after 3 prompts .... Cursor after 7 prompts was unable to fix it and I think Sonnet in Cursor just doesn't understand.\n\nFor $20 you don't get that much and Cursor optimizes prompts and models to cut costs and it works so badly sometimes that you find that the $20 isn't worth that much",

    "selftext": "I still have the last months of Cursor Pro with a small budget and Claude Max. In comparison, Cursor requires more prompts to solve the same bugs and create the same views.\n\nCursor added Sonnet 4 and Opus quite quickly so I was curious if it was once again they made the same mistakes and once again there are a lot of problems as with the situation with Gemini 2.5 or ChatGpt and I was not wrong, still the situation is repeated.\n\nAt first it was not even possible to use the new model because there was an error \"subscription did not cover it\", then quickly a fix appeared and Sonnet 4 and Opus were running....\n\nWhat are the problems so far?\n- Entering the prompt AND requesting changes often ends in an error and you have to repeat the prompt task. For this error and server failures you lose the pool from fast tokens. Repeating almost 80% of the time does not work because it throws the same error, and you lose tokens again, the only way out is to open a new chat\n- Prompts and contexts are severely clipped, a rather detailed prompt related to writing tests for data synchronization was completed in half the points and on top of that required consuming 2 more prompts for fix, Claude used directly did it for 1 prompt with one error which was so simple that I fixed it myself (const for not const value)\n- complicated bugs in audio and problems with sound was fixed using Claude code after secind approach, same prompts did not the job in Cursor, after 7 times i gave up because it had a problem to fix it.\n- Opus works worse, I wanted to plan and build base for auto cache data which Cursor did after 5 prompts and Claude Code after 3 prompts.\n\n\nIn short, Cursor may have been the first, but once again with the release of new models has the same errors AND problems. And after their recent changes with optimization of prompts and requests Sonnet with them is just worse and requires more time and prompts. Not worth tbh.\n\nSo don't worry about Windsurf not having new Claude models right now. Claude works with Cursor that's why they were first, and Windsurf is a competitive product so it's clear they won't give them access so soon xd\nOnly Claude made a bad choice because Cursor now saves quite a bit, they keep making mistakes, they don't learn from them and situations with new model releases keep happening. So it is what it is, maybe they have access but so poor that half the time it will take you to repeat the prompts xD",

Yesterday, both Claude 3.7 and Gemini 2.5 in MAX mode couldn't find a solution to a bug on the first try, which I described in great detail regarding where and why (except I didn't write the code, I don't know how). I went to sleep sad. Now I woke up and Claude 4 solved it on the first try, also in MAX mode. Maybe it's a coincidence, but I'm impressed. Let's see how many reverts I'll do today with Claude 4, with Claude 3.7 and Gemini 2.5 (always MAX), this happens many times a day.\n\nI love Windsurf and wrote 90% of my app with Windsurf, but I no longer have the strength to struggle with context limitations. Windsurf immediately needs a \"MAX mode\" without context limitations. Read 200 lines is ridiculous. That's why I've been using Cursor for a week, first time, sad, just for the MAX mode, and this solved my problem of refactoring large 1000+ line files! Hey Windsurf, maybe now with BYOK is the best moment to remove the file reading and context limitation, because now the user will be paying for it, right? Make it at least 600 lines, or better yet, 800-1000.",

In Windsurf you write your prompt and another kinda AI like will traverse through your code base to fetch and guess all important files. The downside on aider is that mostly I and not any automation like in Windsurf will define what is important for refactoring.\n\nWhat you can do to help Windsurf: reference files with @ and directories in the prompt to mimic a manual selection of relevant input so that hopefully Windsurf will send all import input files into the LLM so that the LLM will understand the whole context to be able to do the refactoring with as much knowledge as possible.\n\nAlso try to write more long prompts and give Windsurf more guidance in what you want to achieve (this applies to every AI coding assistant).\n\nAlso kinda important in my experience: Use thinking/reasoning models like Gemini 2.5 Pro for refactorings.",

Did Windsurf change the model to a mini SWE-1 or something?\n\nI have run into repeated incorrect, less intelligent tabs. It will suggest things that sound connected but aren't if you think about it, like writing \"google\" instead of \"gemini\" or suggesting over specific completions rather than what matters in the full code's context. It is producing more lines of code successfully and good row jumps, but the important thing, the quality and that it is on the same page as me on the code, feels much worse.\n\nI know the team is confident about SWE and wish you luck in improving it, but I personally feel like this has gone backwards. There is little that would cause me to churn to a new UI now that I am in the groove of things, but this is definitely one of them.",

    "selftext": "The Claude 4 issue, or Windsurf-Anthropic doesn't seem to be resolved any time soon. As this delay is caused by friction with Anthropic and Windsurf after the acquisition. And as builders can tell, a coding tool without Anthropic is next to useless. I don't think OpenAI will want to make much effort to resolve this, and also in the future.  This is also reflected by their choice to push for BYOK for Anthropic models. Which will be completely impractical since it will be very expensive with direct keys, they want us to see that maybe.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/267igb41di2f1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=359ab9482b7f1c4cd536d3bfe25f27ab1e0b3a67\n\nI am going to have to check with Cursor after a long time, sadly having to cancel my subscription with early adopter pricing if this won't have any hopes in the coming days.\n\nI won't be surprised if OpenAI pushes to make customize it to suit their models and be like a GUI for their Codex CLI... very likely. But for users, Windsurf was better if it stayed independent, and optimize itself for any of the SOTA model to shine. Anthropic for now\n\nI am not complaining, great for the guys that built Windsurf, you sold and made good money. You did what you had to do. 👏👏 🫡\n\n**But for us users, we lost a great independent tool with a great future.**\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nAlmost everyone is missing the point. The current issue with Claude 4 isn't a \"testing delay\" or some QA delay. The CEO clarified what happened. Their relationship with Anthropic has taken a hit. (most probably due to the acquisition). And the reason for the issue is with Anthropic saying they won't keep providing what they used to for windsurf, clearly as its a competition owned by OpenAI now.\n\nI am just saying it would have been great for users if Windsurf stayed independent.\n\nWindsurf actually wants us to test the new claude models, even have it faster than anyone for marketing. This clearly is no way \"testing delay\". They even were forced to bring it as a BYOK just to list it (as opposed to their view on BYOK). Just because they couldn't get provision from Anthropic as before.\n\nThe post is about the future implications for windsurf, whenever SOTA models will be non OpenAI, which is will also likely be the case in the future.\n\nMore bad implication: Windsurf CEO fueling the beef with Anthropic  \n[https://x.com/\\_mohansolo/status/1925653658982576370](https://x.com/_mohansolo/status/1925653658982576370)",

        "body": "So here is my take:  \nThe model is just released, and while I fully understand people are hyped to use is straight away. Why not let some expert first evaluate it, and see how they can best integrate it within the IDE? I think the new BYOK is great, as it can help you to directly test it on release (also for the future for newer models) while Windsurf is integrating it within their platform.\n\nIf you can't wait, you can use your own key. Otherwise you've to wait until the release of the model within the IDE. If they release it just like Cursor did, people will also be discussing how bad it performs within the IDE. The \"old\" models did work perfectly fine (atleast for me). So continue with them, and give Windsurf some time to perfectly integrate it within the IDE. I want quality, not a vibe coded mess.",

I don't know that anything's been confirmed about an acquisition but it makes sense.  A new toy comes out you definitely can't be the last one to the table so they had to do something.\n\n'stayed independent' really doesn't mean anything.  You never in a million years going to make your money back at 10 and 15 bucks a month.\n\nThey had a massive influx of capital to release a tool at the same time or before the other two or three came out.  Remember at the start it was a buggy mess.   They had to capture all those eyeballs right away.\n\nWhatever buying price is has to makes sense for both companies obviously.  Codium priciples gets the cash open AI gets the eyeballs.  That's why you build things to sell anyway in the first place.\n\nMy guess is they roll in the subscription price into their online coder and the Standalone UI goes away. Then of course later on the subscription price raises.\n\nObviously you're going to have a friction point as anthropic has their own online coder, and they want that to telemetry in a bad way. The only thing that has any value.  Because you refactor your agent everyday or weekend or whatever to make it just a little bit better, and that's playing for all the marbles.

I still believe that to be true but I think that the team is expecting us to use workflows that we don't necessarily know we should be using. I for one would probably benefit greatly from video tutorials showing cool workflows, helpful tips, best practices, important changelog related things. \n\nIt seems like a small change to Windsurf can have disproportionate effects for people who don't have the same mental model for how to use Windsurf as the Windsurf team does.\n\nIt would just be helpful to have a more standardized workflow. I think video content would go a long way to minimizing the complaints and frustrations people have had lately. ",

    "title": "Testing SWE-1 vs Sonnet 3.7 vs o4mini-high",
    "selftext": "This is my own two cents, curious to hear what others have to say.\n\nI started using Windsurf about a week ago,  and I’m working on  porting + improving an app onto my VPS. The app contains multiple interconnected workflows, and I’m adding some more functions and tweaking some steps. I currently run it local on my laptop but I need it on the cloud to avoid keeping my laptop awake and running 24/7, so, I decided to test how Windsurf could help me with that.\n\nI’ve been using the three models above to help writing, tweaking, deploying, checking, pulling/pushing code to git etc…I spent several hours each day on it, trying to get a gist of how each model performs on Windsurf.\n\nso far, Sonnet 3.7 did very well, got most of the code correctly and understood directions. I liked how it automatically debugged errors that were coming up while writing code. It also check the rules I gave it every time it was creating an answer, and I really like d that. \n\nSWE-1 was challenging, it did not always follow the rules (while I could see Sonnet 3.7 checking them each time), and created a lot of code that I did not want. It did run some debug but at times was unable to fix errors.\n\no4-mini-high took its time to go through the whole GitHub repo, analyzing files over and over after each edit to make sure that they edits in one file did not affect negatively the others. It did create some code I did not want but overall was quite good. It was slower than the other models and I could not see it checking the rules like Sonnet did\n\nOverall, Sonnet 3.7 (thinking) was the winner for me. It was also the most expensive but the one that overall gave the best outcome .\nI was a bit underwhelmed by SWE-1, and a bit frustrated due to the numerous errors in coding and in understanding how different modules/files/classes were connected. It is free, which is great, but I think it needs some love. \no4-mini-high was interesting, when I asked it similar questions using ChatGPT, yes it was a pain to upload the files, but it did actually really well, and that’s why I decided to use it in Windsurf. It still did good but the extra filler code I didn’t want was more of a pain than anything else.\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps. Ciao!",

No error, no update, no revert. I've tried updating Windsurf to the latest version, but the issue persists.\n\nRight now my project is in a completely unusable state due to the half-applied revert, and I can't seem to roll back or move forward.\n\nHas anyone encountered this kind of behavior before? Any way to force a proper reset or cleanup?\n\nThanks in advance for any help 🙏",

Training frontier models required us to question many assumption in leading papers, and build our own intuitions/methods from first principles.  \n  \n2. **Details matter.** Eliminating small inconsistencies at the token level or even logits-level can have outsized impacts on training stability and ultimately model performance.  \n  \n3. **Optimizing training infrastructure is essential.** Every hour spent on optimizing training pipelines enabled us to experiment 10x more. Cannot overstate this enough.\n\n  \nSee the thread from Ronak here: [https://x.com/rronak\\_/status/1924823609501221362](https://x.com/rronak_/status/1924823609501221362)",

It seems like a lot of the time, the first instinct is to modify the tests so that the function passes, whether that's mocking some API or function call, or sometimes explicitly changing control flow when in test state. It's super annoying. \n\nI find that it works best when you either write the tests all yourself, and more importantly, tell it that it cannot change the test file at all when attempting to get the test to pass. (Windsurf Rules help here, but aren't followed absolutely.) Even with that explicit instruction, it can tend to forget that \"guidance\", so you need to keep an eye and make sure that it's not changing the tests on you inadvertently.",

List of rentals another. You can store queries in them, or use Pinia if you want sync changes on the frontend.\n\nIf you don't guide model (any) it will mix stuff up and eventually it starts to loose himself in what it generated and it will break features that already worked.\n\nIf you want more tips you can check out my newsletter : [newsletter ](https://tomasz-smykowski.com/vibe-coding)",

I wasn't sure what I wanted to build to test it, so I chose one of it's default prompts that I was offered, to build a personal website. It asked me a few questions and then set out to build it. After an hour and a half of multiple failed executions and Node.js errors, I told the program I was no longer interested and to submit the log as feedback to the development team. The attached screenshot is the closest it got to completing the task. I've also attached the file structure so people don't think I'm just posting some kind of \"bash Windsurf\" post. \n\n  \nI went in legitimately excited to try it after hearing about it and left horribly disappointed.

    "selftext": "I've been having a persistent issue in Windsurf where the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from my `.env` file isn't being respected inside the Windsurf terminal, even though it works perfectly in my system's PowerShell or JupyterLab.\n\nHere's what’s happening:\n\n* My `.env` file contains the correct OpenAI API key.\n* I use `load_dotenv()` in my Python scripts, and `os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")` reads it correctly in standard environments.\n* But inside Windsurf’s integrated terminal (even within a virtual environment), it seems to fall back to an old or incorrect key—one that I **never explicitly set in my code**.\n* Running `Get-ChildItem Env:OPENAI_API_KEY` shows *different results* depending on whether I'm in Windsurf or regular PowerShell.\n* I’ve deleted `.cache`, `.openai`, and `rag_index` folders, restarted the IDE, and tried new keys. Still hitting OpenAI `401 Unauthorized` errors **only from within Windsurf**.\n\nThis affects any project using OpenAI (via llama-index or the `openai` library). But the same code works flawlessly outside Windsurf.\n\nIs there some internal environment caching or session scoping happening in Windsurf I should know about? Any known workaround or upcoming fix?\n\nThanks for any insight.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nCurious how others are dealing with the way Windsurf seems to change its model heuristics daily. I get that iteration is part of the game, but it’s getting hard to trust anything when what works one day suddenly starts behaving differently the next.\n\nIt feels like there’s zero stability—some days completions are solid, and others it’s like the model’s drunk. I’ve seen other posts here from people clearly frustrated by the same thing.\n\nSo I wanted to ask both users and anyone from the Windsurf team:\n\n - How are you adapting to the constant shifts?\n\n - Any tools or workflows you’ve set up to detect or handle changes?\n\n -   And to the Windsurf devs—could we maybe get some kind of changelog or heads-up when the heuristics get updated? Even a daily diff would help a ton.\n\nRight now, it just feels like we’re all flying blind. Would love to hear how others are managing it.",

I call it AmpCoding; it amplifies me, but I remain in control.\n\nI set up my project, including Git, to ensure no tool can disrupt my project. If something goes completely wrong, I can revert to the last working state without issue.\n\nSecond, I have clear guidelines in rule files that the project must follow, outlining project setup and acceptable tools/imports/languages and frameworks.\n\nThen, for each feature, I create (or partially generate) a planning file—a step-by-step guide (Markdown file) for the agent. I mostly use GPT 4.1 for backend code and Sonnet 3.7 for frontend. For full Stack I sometimes switch to Gemini. For simple and quick edits (and when I am lazy) I use a free model. The better the planning file, the fewer prompts (and credits) are needed.\n\nI occasionally test other models for new features to stay up-to-date, but this remains my workflow. This is important because a significant downside of Sonnet is its context window, which is difficult to manage.  Even GPT 4.1, with its 1 million token window, becomes slow quickly (people have measured it at around 30,000 tokens).  Mismanaging this can easily cause problems for you and your project.\n\nWhen a feature is implemented and tested, I always commit before moving to the next feature. And always starting a new chat for a new feature (again, context window management). \n\nThat's a quick overview of my approach and how I use these models. 🤩",

I know there's dozens of apps like MacWhisper out there, but I like how much granularity MacWhisper offers. \n\n\nI doubt transcription accuracy can be the same since Mac Whisper let's you pick from even the largest whisper models for more accuracy or better multilingual support. Accuracy is directly influenced by model size, and Voice Type's largest \"accurate model\" is 500mb. I think that's considered the small MacWhisper model. Large Turbo V3 is 1.5gb.\n\n\nAlso, I kind of like that it supports not just dictation. As transcribing meeting recordings or voice memos from other device is incredibly practical and I rely on it a lot. And that's without even considering MacWhisper letting you bring your own API key to use it to clean up dictation or summarize transcripts.

I am hoping to specify requirements clearly via the tests, and drive Windserf to keep updating both code and tests to get what I want.  At a time, Windserf made a wrong edit of duplicating a form, and the test code cannot find the result after the submit clicking.  It spends hours trying all kinds of alternatives (like changing button type, tweaking test code to fake it etc), even I kept asking it focus on debugging the real problem.  Hours were wasted, and probably many credits were also wasted there.  Eventually i had to dive in to debug it myself, and it is a simple duplicated form causing the problem.  \nMaybe I am a heavy user for trying to be hands-free and driving Windserf to develop both the code and tests testing against its code.",

I mostly was trying to illustrate the differences in both credit usage and outcomes between heavy Cascade usage and more measured, thoughtful prompting. I've spent time vibing and trying to get as much output as I can quickly... And ultimately it doesn't seem to work as well as when I try to lay out my own architecture, be thoughtful about separation of concerns, take a critical eye to any generated code. For a project of any complexity, I think I get to a good state quicker with less prompting/credit usage. (This applies to Windsurf/Cascade, as well as other tools like RooCode with direct API usage.) With this approach to prompting and my usage (which I would describe as a heavy hobbyist), it feels like 500 credits/mo is plenty, especially when considering the access to free/cheap models like SWE-1 and GPT 4.1.\n\nSorry to hear that you lost your job.

    "selftext": "Noticed two issues:  \n  \n1. Can't find gemini models anymore to use?\n\nFor my use case Gemini 2.5 pro has worked THE BEST. Gemini series seems to have suddenly disappeared form model selection. Maybe this is related to the acquisition? IDK. But I literally open AI studio on the side, dump my codebase file-by-file into it, and use 2.5 pro to get real code snippets that I copy-paste into Windsurf. This is soooo suboptimal. I was happy using 2.5 pro in Windsurf directly. Claude thinking is closest in terms of code output so sometimes I use that. But no other models in the Windsurf dropdown seem as good anymore.\n\n  \n2. GPT 4.1 (promo) feels outright dumb. I asked for a simple UI improvement and provided clear instructions along with some images of my current UI. Got the following (IMO pretty dumb) response from 4.1 in windsurf.  \n  \n\\> Thank you for the context. How can I assist you next with your project? If you have any new UI bugs, feature requests, or want to continue improving the chat or citation display, let me know the specifics and I'll help you implement them!\n\nThis is just 1 example. Feels like a waste of credits. Would have moved faster with Gemini 2.5. What's going on? Anyone else see this?  \n",

Extremely frustrated and disappointed with your non responsive attitude and negligence of acknowledging the problem.  I haven't been able to use windsurf for the 7th continuous day. My pro plan was downgraded to Free plan as their third party payment service failed to process the monthly auto payment. I was one of the early adopter of pro plan and now being treated like a beggar.  Now they want me to pay 15 dollars per month just because their 1 attempt for monthly auto payment failed. Didn't even give me a chance to check what might have gone wrong.  The same auto payment was done regularly for so many months successfully. \n\nI'm absolutely disgusted with their non cooperative attitude.  They never respond personally through email.  AI responses are terrific and not addressing the real problem. ",

Then it ended, I continued using it then it started to waiver. Switched back to 3.7 thinking, was doing ok, but noticed it kept failing to refactor and getting into a bad habit of creating new files because of errors on the old file, and got into this trail of constant new versions \"simplifying\" the approach. At one point for a test, it built it with console.log outputs with the text stating the stage at which the test should be, if you ran it, you would think it was a working test, but reading the test it wasn't.\n\nNow recently it's just not really performing as well without heavier direction and instructions, not the worst thing of course, better for refinement and specific outcomes, but it does struggle, plenty errors, plenty editing again and again. There was a time recently that it stopped reading the cascade outputs and then not continuing so then I had to manually make it copy and paste the output from the terminal to the chat. The update seemed to fix this but now there's an issue updating with the latest and I'm getting an error, not addressed it fully I'm just going to keep working through it for now until they release another new one, see if that overrides this issue.",

(It is much slower though)  \n  \nAnd looking at the benchmarks (https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/o4-mini/prompt-options/single/100k) it seems to me that it is clearly the best option to use right now.   \n   \nI had a chance to test SWE-1 today and while it seems fast it is still simply forgets to use context7 mcp when the promt is: \"Do the task .... Make sure to use.... Use context7 for latest documentation\"   \nWHILE o4-mini-high just needs one sentence in the first request and later it uses context7 even if I did not specify it. \n\nFinally: So far I find it hard and messy to use all currently listed models except o4-mini-high if I need to the model to actually create something new that would work and do not reorganize project for example which any model that came out in last year is capable of doing. Please let me know what you guys think about it.\n\nUPD: Looking at documentation Gpt4.1 has much longer context window (1M tokens) compared to all other models but as many people specify it here, it keeps asking to do the basic tasks or simply does not do it.",

There is never any warning about context limitations or that you are running out of \"quality\" context and should start a new conversation.

[Manus.im](http://Manus.im) does this as well via \"inheriting context\" from previous conversation and starts a \"fresh\" task within the same conversation window.  \n  \nThere is never any communication in Windsurf regarding how the memory system works, the changes it has been going through, and what will be coming in the future. Context management and memory felt stronger a few months ago and they were premier features that made me switch from Cursor, GitHub Co-Pilot, Claude Code Agent, Codex, etc.   \n  \nBut, as the OpenAI deal whispers began and the integration showed up in the IDE the other day everything has deteriorated. I can't quite put a \"finger\" on it.

I'm very excited to see how this does in real world use!\n\n**Edit**: I appreciate that they acknowledge this model \"is not the absolute frontier\", but they see potential to be competitive with such models. However I'm a little concerned about the experiments that they've run—do they mean that some of the time that you're asking for a Claude response, you get an SWE response? Or is this just an experiment that is run for requests to Cascade-Base? I feel like my requests to Cascade Base aren't representative of my normal workflow, and that my requests that I'm paying to go to Claude should actually go to Claude. **I'd love to hear the Windsurf team clarify how these experiments are run**. \n\nI'm certainly not against doing experiments overall, but it feels wrong to 1) ask for a certain model and not get that model, and 2) be paying full-price for the privilege of being \"lied to.\" My 2c suggestion would be to have a Cascade-experimental model that charges some nominal discount over the standard frontier model pricing, and it's always running the experiments. So say your average frontier model costs 1c/req, Cas-exp could be 0.8c/req. And it's routing between SWE, Claude, Gemini, 4.1, etc. Presumably you'd do this in a way that the balance of credits would've worked out to a cost in the 0.8-1.0c/req range. This way users are knowingly opting in to this experiment, and aren't risking their time being wasted.",

Id still strongly recommend also maintaining improvements on the smaller and faster models - there's a reason Gemini flash is used much more than Gemini pro, despite the superiority.\n\nAlso, have you ever thought about making dedicated autocomplete models per-language like Jetbrains, or per repository like ninetyfive.gg? SuperMaven wasn't the smartest, but for many months I used it instead of codeium due to it's insane speed and context (they used an RNN architecture instead of transformers LLM)\n\nMaybe even look at qwen finetuned like this example\n\nhttps://prvn.sh/build-your-own-github-copilot/",

Absolutely my number one AmpCoding tool.\n\nThe website I mostly built with Windsurf (and of course, coded myself): [craftingaiprompts.org](http://craftingaiprompts.org).  It's a website to learn prompt engineering, learn vibe and AmpCoding. Share your thoughts, reviews, and ratings of tools, do challenges, store prompts and all kinds of graphs to see how tools compare. All for free.\n\nAnd guess what? Windsurf is also ranked first for coding here. 🤩\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gyj8l7hi272f1.jpeg?width=1931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bb69deaa9689ab0d55ac839add58b26f8cb0f71\n\nI am really looking forward what others built!

We live in an era of rapid technological advancement, with knowledge growing at an exponential rate. But as our access to information increases, our core values, principles, and essential human skills appear to be fading.\n\nConsider the past—just 30 to 50 years ago. High school students demonstrated remarkable linguistic abilities, a rich vocabulary, and a deeper sense of critical thinking. Their understanding of literature, philosophy, and history was not just academic—it was a part of their identity. Today, despite the abundance of educational resources, we often find a decline in these fundamental skills. Our words may be more, but their depth feels less.\n\nOur physical well-being tells a similar story. Medicine, treatments, and healthcare technologies have multiplied many times over. There are more doctors, specialists, and therapeutic options than ever before. Yet, paradoxically, chronic illnesses are more prevalent, and mental health challenges are at an all-time high. In a world where we should be healthier, we are often more unwell.\n\nThis paradox extends beyond individuals—it is a cultural and societal phenomenon. As artificial intelligence accelerates our capabilities, automating tasks and enhancing our productivity, we must ask: Are we becoming smarter or simply more efficient? Are we gaining wisdom or losing touch with what it means to be human?\n\nEvery day, we are enveloped in noise—digital distractions, endless notifications, and constant connectivity. But beneath this noise, a quiet question lingers: What are we losing? What essential parts of our humanity are being drowned out in the chaos?\n\nPerhaps it is time to pause, to reflect, and to reclaim what truly matters—our words, our values, our health, and our shared sense of purpose.\n\nAre we loosing or already LOST THE battle ? Even are we are that there are a BATTLE ?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been using Windsurf a lot lately to help generate code from pseudo-code, especially when prompting tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor. It’s a game changer not having to type everything out manually, but I’m still finding the workflow a bit clunky, specifically with punctuation and formatting when speaking the pseudo-code.\n\nFor example, I might say something like:  \n“Function calculateSum open parenthesis list of numbers close parenthesis colon newline indent return sum open parenthesis list of numbers close parenthesis.”\n\nWindsurf does a pretty good job transcribing the words, but I still have to go back and manually add the parentheses, colons, newlines, indents, and fix any small errors. It’s definitely better than typing it all, but it still slows me down.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has found good ways to improve this workflow? Any tricks for getting better punctuation and formatting when dictating pseudo-code? Are there Windsurf settings I might be missing, or is this just something I have to live with?\n\nI know there are other voice dictation tools out there, I think I saw something called WillowVoice mentioned somewhere, but I really like how tightly Windsurf integrates into my workflow. Just curious if there’s a way to make it even smoother for this specific use case.\n\nAny tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated!",

Every model has a context window, and when you go outside of that window, the oldest context gets dropped out. Which means that as your conversation gets longer and longer, the awareness of the model diminishes for older items. Windsurf does mitigate this to a certain degree by using a deeply embedded memory feature. But it does not completely overcome going outside of a model‘s context window. Best practice is still to research the model that you’re going to use, understand the size of its context window, and keep your chats within that span. Because windsurf does not track this and show you, you are estimating a little bit. But it is a good practice to keep your task small, and to switch chats between tasks.",

It was like generated by someone who is learning to put together html page and makes basic mistakes.\n\nMy Question to Windsurf users/experts:\nHow do i get windsurf to get me good quality webapp (primarily looks and feel?).

They will get you a decent but cookie cutter looking Ui with base functions, but then as you build off of it, you will start to notice things breaking down. This has been my experience and that of some of my coworkers.\n\nWith Windsurf you need to think like a developer, PM, and designer.  \n  \nYou will want to create a file that has all of your project details. I use Claude to do the initial planning, but you can use anything for this, just save it as a file in your repo.  \n  \nThen you want to plan out what tech stack you want to build with. Same as above, this just needs to be a file in your repo. I usually ask for multiple options when picking my tech stack and review the pros and cons.\n\nThen you will want to provide some design system. You can ask to use Tailwind, or create one yourself using a reference image or ui designs/ a style guide. Im a designer so i usually build my own style guide and have windsurf turn that into tokens + semantic classes to use those tokens. I also have a global rule to use semantic classes whenever making new ones. \n\nThen you have Windsurf review your project details, the tech stack, and design system. Ask it to create a project plan that will break things down into manageable scopes.\n\nStart a new chat and start to execute on that project plan.\n\nI also include things like a bug log, which records all the bugs i encounter and how i solved them.\n\nYou will have a lot more control in Windsurf over tools like Bolt, but it will be more upfront planning.  \nJust like working with a team, if you just ask someone to execute something without planning your results will vary, but if you plan things out you can always reference back to the plan to make sure you are aligned.",

    "selftext": "I've been working on a tricky feature for the last couple days, and every time I've brought in Claude, I've ended up taking big steps backwards and ultimately discarded all of the generated code. \n\nToday I decided to try o3 with the exact same prompt I had just tried with Claude 3.7 Thinking. \n\nFirst prompt: it gets probably 80% of the way to what I'm trying to achieve. Fantastic. Easily worth 10 credits. \n\nSecond prompt: I identify the problems with the implementation—I identify the problems, and say what I'm looking for instead. It does a bunch of tool calling and says thanks for the feedback. Oof. I guess I didn't explicitly tell it that we need to fix the problems, but it was implied strongly enough that I didn't feel that it was a bad prompt. \n\nThird prompt: I repeat the prompt and clarify that the expectation is to fix the issues so that the behavior matches what I described. Identify the cause, implement a fix, and verify that the fix works. It calls a bunch of tools, doesn't edit any code. Ultimately tokens out and asks me to continue. \n\nFourth prompt: \"Continue.\" It reviews a bunch more code... Uses browser MCP to take a screenshot which clearly shows it not working... And then says it's reviewed the code and it all looks good and should work. No files edited. \n\n\n\nSo now I'm 40 tokens in to this path and I'm left wondering—was my first prompt a fluke? Is it always this lazy/stubborn? Does it struggle with context beyond the first message? ",

It is the most accurate and precise but I almost always tell it “use all your tools” because sometimes it tends to forget it has some tools it can use. Claude tends to make improper assumptions without more extensive planning and Gemini does something similar. I’d ask any of these though for a plan and root cause analysis, add logging, etc for troubleshooting so the AI becomes clear on the issue.\n2. If you don’t know what’s wrong with the code it’s much much harder for you to direct the AI clearly. Most of the time when AI gets off I’ve eventually realized it was a me problem. I misunderstood the problem I was having or thought I need it to fix X but it couldn’t because Y and Z didn’t work as expected. \n\nI no longer use 1 model for every decision. I flip between models and I revert the chat all the time if it doesn’t fix the issue after three or so messages because the deeper you go with problems in context, the more trouble the AI will have and the more it will struggle to get things right.",

    "selftext": "I'm not sure if this will be useful to anyone else, but this approach has been so consistently effective for me that I thought it was worth sharing. One of the most important things I've learned while working with AI tools is that asking them directly what they will respond to best can yield amazing results.\n\nHere's what works: Start a new chat, tell it exactly what result you want to achieve, and ask it to repeat that back to you in as detailed a manner as possible. Look over that detailed restating of your goal and ensure it is correct (correct the AI and try again until you are on the same page). Then ask it to come up with a prompt that IT would best understand/utilize to achieve your goal and to include its thought process. Next, have it scrutinize its own thought process, finding logical flaws or missing details. Finally, have it revise the prompt based on those insights.\n\nI know this seems extreme but if you can create a prompt that does EXACTLY what you want almost every time, it is worth it. I keep these prompts in markdown files using Obsidian.\n\nIf you want to get a bit more advanced, you can connect Obsidian to Cascade via an MCP server and have it search for relevant prompts when needed. Just make sure you name the files in a way that will be easy to parse in its search.",

This seems to be the a result of it's training focused on instruction following and lower temperature, which increases it's \"tightness\" or conciseness with the outputs.\n\nSpeaking of Claude 3.7, it acts more autonomously and makes some decisions itself. This makes it more seamless and fast. This is probably because of higher top K/p which increases it's creativity and allows it to act more freely.  \nAlso can also be controlled by System Prompt up to some degree.\n\nIt's still hard to determine the exact differentiator so we can only make speculations.\n\nFeel free to drop your opinions about this..",

Even if a “@“ the file, it seems to take it as a suggestion and then just read snippets or chunks, and then hallucinate the rest or claim it’s fully read it.\n\nIt also at times grabs context that is irrelevant without request and then gets confused.\n\nIt has terrible amnesia after sometimes even just a few turns later in a chat, which then causes many models to hallucinate.\n\nWindsurf got me to try it again when they tried to adopt Cursor’s new rules system (although inability to inline/link other rules or docs is a huge handicap).\n\nAt this point I’d rather use Continue, Roo, or Cline just to pay for and use the full context length and have clearer control and transparency of what’s in context.\n\nCursor’s most recent update now offering full-context usage with just token cost + margin pricing and clearer transparency of which files are fully or partially in context returns it to being the clear winner over Windsurf for me.\n\nAfter trying to give Windsurf an real shot and effort over the past few days, the handicapped context window just makes it feel broken, and I’m 100% confident I would have completed more work without it than with it.",

I'm very experienced at computer science and tend to have up-to-date skills in spec writing, systems design, data modelling, security, etc. But since I don't code regularly anymore, any personal project starts with my spending a couple of days reading API and library documents and brushing up on whatever language I'm using.\n\nThe old joke used to be \"if I could compile a Visio Diagram, I'd be dangerous\". So that's what I did. I wrote a real set of requirements and architecture documents. I also stole a lot of concepts from Cline's memory-bank concept.\n\nWindsurf's \"cascade base\" did a much better job of creating a plan from the specs. Both Cursor and Cline used Claude 3.7 Sonnet and their breakdowns reflected that in their similarity. \n\nWindsurf followed the instructions and spec very well. It created the cleanest MVP. Cursor was second. Cline was third, and required way more babysitting. It kept creating errors with the Vite server and by the time I got an MVP it had 10 running Vite servers.\n\nI could try the experiment of taking the specs prepared by Windsurf and feed it to Cursor, but that just seems like extra steps with little value. \n\nI'm finding Windsurf works the best for how I want to \"vibe code\". Given the simplicity of adding the Supabase and GutHub MCP servers, this seems like the best option, even if their pricing model is a mess and they don't allow you to use your own API keys.",

I work on a large enterprise codebase that has a ton of boilerplate code for modules. Every time I build a new module as of a few weeks ago, I need to walk Windsurf through it step by step whereas last month I could ask it to start a new module for me and it would perfectly generate 8 files of boilerplate code.

Here's what works: Start a new chat, tell it exactly what result you want to achieve, and ask it to repeat that back to you in as detailed a manner as possible. Look over that detailed restating of your goal and ensure it is correct (correct the AI and try again until you are on the same page). Then ask it to come up with a prompt that IT would best understand/utilize to achieve your goal and to include its thought process. Next, have it scrutinize its own thought process, finding logical flaws or missing details. Finally, have it revise the prompt based on those insights. I know this seems extreme but if you can create a prompt that does EXACTLY what you want almost every time, it is worth it. I keep these prompts in markdown files using Obsidian. If you want to get a bit more advanced, you can connect Obsidian to Cascade via an MCP server and have it search for relevant prompts when needed. Just make sure you name the files in a way that will be easy to parse in its search.",

You should write things out as much as you possibly can and, only when totally stuck, highlight whatever you're having a problem with and ask Cascade about it in order to move forward. \n\nIf you have the willpower to do that and not just do a bunch of autocompletes and Cascade tasks, you learn a hell of a lot.\n\nSpend some time doing it that way, and then it will make more sense to start using the tools in their full capacity, because you'll at least have some concept of what to do when the AI inevitably can't handle making further features and adjustments without serious guidance.  As a project grows in complexity, this will always happen.\n\nSince your nephew is a bit younger than people usually are when they start coding, maybe just seeing the repetitions would be good at first. So he could read what Cascade is telling him and copy the suggested code over himself, etc without too much cognitive load.\n\nIf it's not really about learning how to make programs and just playing around, then yes you could just set it to Gemini and ask it to make a little zero shot application of some kind and it will usually work after a few tries.",

If I had blindly looked to them as \"teachers\" I would have learned a lot of terrible ways to do simple things (the most common problem, in my experience, is vastly overcomplicating simple things).\n\nSo I maintain that you don't need much prior experience to begin using them. However, you have to sort of learn the right way as you go along and unlearn some of what you see them doing.\n\nI don't know what to compare it to. Like a fumbling teacher with moments of genius that's also totally wrong about 30% of the time (LOL).",

I’d like to allow Windsurf to execute such commands silently while keeping prompts only for those that modify system state.\n\n### Examples of Commands That Should Run Without Consent:\n\n```\nuptime  \nwhoami  \nls -l /usr/bin  \ndf -h  \ncat /etc/os-release  \nbrew --version  \n```\n\nThese are standard diagnostic or read-only commands and don’t change anything on the system. Ideally, I want Windsurf to be able to:\n\n- Detect that a command is **non-mutating** (doesn’t write/change files),\n- Skip the consent dialog for those, and\n- Continue prompting only for commands that can alter system state.\n\n### My Goal:\n\n- **Security maintained** — no auto-run for `rm`, `mv`, `touch`, `chmod`, etc.\n- **Automation enabled** — full auto-run for harmless diagnostics.\n\n### Has anyone figured out a way to configure Windsurf to:\n1. Automatically allow these read-only commands?\n2. Maybe whitelist specific commands or patterns?\n3. Run from a config file, permission rule, or environment flag?\n\nI know there is a way to do this but I don't know how to do this. \n\nSomeone was mentioning it somewhere on reddit or X. \n\nThanks for the help. \n",

If you do bash development and use Bats, which is good, I don’t want the AI to run them….cuz sometimes it has a tendency to add rm -rf to an env var as a clean up step…and if the env var is empty, it can delete your home directory.\n\nIt may or may not be a true story. I may or many not had to test my backups that day. 🤣(the backups worked fine! If that happened…. 😂)\n\nSo yeah, even if you trust your test suite with npm, bundle or whatnot depending on your stack…you still need to make sure your tests are non destructive.\n\nWhat you can do, also, is to get your tests to run in a Docker container (with act or something else) to be even safer.",

Deployed with Netlify.  \n\nAll free tiers (except Pro plan on Windsurf)\n\nStill need to add some functionality to various areas of the app (login with Google/Facebook, etc) but otherwise it should be a fully functional (if somewhat basic) lift tracking web app.\n\nOh also its responsive but mostly optimized for desktop.

But I found that the projects ended up getting big, messy, and filled with spaghetti code. It could kinda work, but it lost the thread architecturally, and kinda got off the rails. Today, I find that I'm a lot more successful by being judicious with my prompts. Tell it exactly what I'm looking for, have it redo if it deviates from my plan.

Then I realized how hard it is to build on that and fix the things that get broken in the process. I used to have it comment in the code what everything did so i could learn what i was doing. That’s when I realized that I was ending up with multiple functions for the same thing, multiple files that override each other, etc. Now I can make a whole lot of credits last a long time because when I want to add a big feature or plan a project, I will go spend 2 days learning how that thing I want to make should work and the various ways of accomplishing it before I go and prompt any AI to start working on it. \n\nAnother thing I have noticed is that sometimes just using a different model can save a lot of effort. Say i’m trying to fix one thing and Claude tried 5 times and can’t do it and is just making a mess of it. I’ll revert, switch to o4 and miraculously it’s fixed in 1 shot. Sometimes you just need another “brain” to look at a problem. That’s the great thing about having multiple to choose from. Yes I use Claude most of the time, but sometimes another model just looks at it differently and can apply a fix when another couldn’t. I think it would be worth it, especially since you say you have a lot of time on your hands, to take time planning out each step. \n\nSometimes i’ll just open chatgpt and have it make me a roadmap or offer a suggestion for a fix. I’ll paste that into windsurf and claude is like “oh that’s a great idea let me try that now” - just use all the free tools you have access to, there’s so many, and you can save a lot of credits and save a lot of time really, since so much is wasted on the mess that’s made when you don’t plan efficiently.",

Or really, the straightforward answer is \"learn to code,\" which isn't super helpful. \n\nIf you don't know how to program at all, it's going to be an uphill battle. I'd probably start by making a Windsurf rule that instructs Cascade to add comments that explain what a section of code does and why it's doing that. Say that you're new to coding and need simple explanations. I'd also probably instruct it to keep things simple. This can at least be a starting point to help you understand what's happening in a given file. \n\nThere are some basic concepts you'll need to learn, but the details vary based on the language. Understanding the idea of object oriented programming is going to be important, assuming the language/framework that you're using uses the object oriented paradigm. As you design how your app will work, you're probably going to want to follow separation of concerns. Don't keep a ton of logic in the UI component, for example. Keep your functions simple and modular. Break your app up into different layers that interact with each other. I'm definitely glossing over the details quickly—but spend a couple hours with ChatGPT talking about these concepts until you feel like you have a solid understanding of them. The great thing about using ChatGPT as your resource is you can use your own specific examples as a learning tool.",

Do more planning in your head, write it down, then create an implementation plan. Tell Gemini your plans for your coding session and let it outline files that need creating and editing with relevant code snippets. Go over it, see if you like it. Only then do you paste that into windsurf, use a weaker powered model as suggested to I’mement these changes. Then test to see if it worked, you’ll be suprisied how many tokens saved! If there are issues then you can switch on reasoning. Building things isn’t all about the code, anid if you’re building for yourself, you also need to think about how you’re gonna distribute which is more important than the thing itself…be more intentional, we all wanna see everyone win - not complain about these awesome tools!
